### Overview
Packages are an invoked piece of software, uploaded to the cloud platform, which customizes a server template. Packages should adhere to the following best practices for increase maintainability and a consistent user deployment experience.

### Adhere to Published Package Maximums
See the published [Package maximums and limits](blueprint-package-and-template-maximum-limits.md). While there are no size limitations note that the maximum execution time for a package is five minutes. This means large network transfers may exceed this limit and should be redesigned.

Mitigate this by:
* Executing long-running tasks in the background so the primary task can exist.  
* In Linux, background tasks also need to close or redirect the stdout/stderr file descriptors (e.g., `>/dev/null 2>&1`).  
* If errors are encountered, your package should send an email to notify.

### Changes to Existing Package Parameters
If your package is part of a Blueprint and the parameters change, this will not be reflected in the Blueprint itself until the Blueprint has been opened for editing and saved.

### Parameter Visibility
Global parameters are shown towards the top of the wizard before any platform-level parameters (such as server password, group, etc.). Keeping all of your package parameters with a global scope keeps them in the same location. Script specific parameters are relegated to the bottom of the page and if not required may be missed.

### Packages and Blueprint Visibility
Any packages that will be included in a Blueprint with a **Shared** or **Public** visibility level must have the same visibility. For example, Public Blueprints must reference only packages that are also public.

### Software vs. Scripts
CenturyLink Cloud includes the concepts of grouping packages into classes of either Software or Scripts. **All new package deployments should be classified as Scripts**. We anticipate deprecating the Software class and many third-party tools have been created to support Scripts rather than software. There is zero functionality differentiation between the two classification types.
