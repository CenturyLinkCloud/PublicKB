### Overview

This article shows how to configure Cloud Application Manager Dedicated Edition (the appliance) to connect to the network, once it's up and running. By default, it tries to get a dynamic IP address via DHCP. However, it is recommended to set a static IP address with the following steps so that Cloud Application Manager services are always available at the same IP address to users.

### Audience

All Cloud Application Manager Dedicated Edition users who wish to configure a *static IP address* for their appliance.

### Prerequisites

* Your Cloud Application Manager Dedicated Edition (appliance) should be properly deployed and running in your preferred platform. You can refer to the [Cloud Application Manager Dedicated Edition documentation](camd-overview.md).
* You need to have access to HTTPS (443) port of the appliance to access its setup console.

### Steps to configure network settings

* Open the VM serial console where you installed the appliance from the vCenter Client or OpenStack console, or directly through the tty console port.

* Enter settings based on your network configuration to set up a static IP address for the appliance. When done, click **Apply**.

  * **IP Address** - Unique IPv4 address the appliance needs to connect to the network.
  * **Netmask** - Subnet mask or address of nearest local area network, for example, 255.255.255.0.
  * **Default Gateway** - Enter the subnet router’s IP address. This is similar to the IP address, except for the last digit.
  * **Name Server** -  Enter the preferred and alternate DNS servers addresses on each name server field.

* Reboot the appliance to apply the configuration changes. In the appliance console, click **Advanced Menu > Reboot**.
