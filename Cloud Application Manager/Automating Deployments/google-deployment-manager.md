### Overview

With Google Deployment Manager you can automate the creation and management of Google Cloud Platform resources, by writing flexible declarative template and configuration files.

### Audience

All Cloud Application Manager users using Google Compute providers.

### Prerequisites

* An active Cloud Application Manager account
* An existing [Google Compute Provider](../Deploying Anywhere/using-google-cloud.md) configured in Cloud Application Manager

### Getting started with Google Deployment Templates on Cloud Application Manager

#### Create or Refresh Provider

You need a Google Compute Provider already set up in Cloud Application Manager in order to use Deployment Manager feature. Go to the Provider's page and Synchronize it first.

#### Create a Deployment Policy Box

Go to *Boxes -> New -> Deployment Policy* and select *Google Deployment*. Fill the usual parameters.
You will need to select a provider if you have more than one Google Compute Providers configured.

A **Default Zone** can be configured in the *Code* tab of the Policy Box. For your convenience, the value of *Default Zone* property is automatically exposed to any Instances deployed with this Policy, as a `zone` variable. Of course its value can be overridden as a Template variable.

### Create a Template Box

Go to *Boxes -> New -> Template* and select *Google Deployment Template* as type. Fill the usual parameters.

For Google Deployment template boxes you can include multiple template files and variables. If there are multiple template files for a Template Box, the first one on the top of the list is marked as the **main template**. The main template can be changed by re-ordering the template files by dragging and moving them with the mouse, or long-pressing and dragging on a touch screen.

![Google Deployment Manager Template Box](../../images/cloud-application-manager/google-deployment-manager/template_box.png)

At least one template file is required to **Deploy** a Template Box. *New Template* dialog can either:

* Create a blank template
* Upload a template file from disk
* Import template files from remote URL

If the URL is a GitHub repository, the contents of that file or directory is automatically imported. If a template file with the same name already exists, it won't get overwritten, but duplicate names will block the deployment, so you need to delete old version template files manually.

Note that files from remote URLs can also be referenced from template files, and they get downloaded and parsed by Google.

### Google Deployment Templates

Check the [Google Cloud Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/configuration/) to learn more about Deployment Template files.

**Warning:** Please bear in mind that referencing resources with the same name from multiple Template Boxes and Google Deployment Manager Templates in general are very dangerous and can lead to undesired consequences.

If you happen to reference resources with the same name in multiple Deployment Instances, for example having a hard-coded name in a Deployment Template File and deploying it multiple times, the same resource is going to be modified by multiple instances at a time, which will lead to undesired consequences and a messed up state of resources. You can even accidentally delete a resource by terminating a deployed Instance, while a different deployment still uses the very same resource. Other times the termination of the Instance might get blocked, because it can not clean up a resource it has deployed, if a different instance has already deleted it.

A good practice to avoid these scenarios is to prefix the name of each resource with the **name of the deployment**, which happens to be the *service-id* in Cloud Application Manager.

```
resources:
- name: \{{ env['deployment'] }}-vm
  type: compute.v1.instance
  properties:
    zone: \{{ properties["zone"] }}
    machineType: projects/\{{ env["project"] }}/zones/\{{ properties["zone"] }}/machineTypes/\{{ properties["machineType"] }}
    disks:
      .....
```

### Box Variables

Box variables are exposed as *properties* for the templates, and can be referenced like `\{{ properties["zone"] }}`. The *zone* variable is automatically crated at deployment time unless the Box defines one, and has the value of *Default Zone* property defined in the Deployment Policy.

Google also defines some useful environment variables automatically:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `env['deployment']` | name of the deployment |
| `env['project']` | project ID |
| `env['name']` | name declared in the upper-level configuration that is using this template |
| `properties['zone']` | *Default Zone* property of the Deployment Policy used |
| `env['project_number']` | project number |
| `env['current_time']` | UTC timestamp |
| `env['type']` | resource type declared in top-level configuration |
| `properties['variable_name']` | Box variables are exposed in *properties* |

Variables can be referenced like `\{{ properties["machineType"] }}` in **Jinja** template files.

Variables can be used only with *Jinja* and *Python* type template files. **Yaml** template files have to be renamed to *jinja* to use variables with them. If the main template file is a **.yaml*, it is automatically renamed as **.jinja* at deployment time.

### Output Variables

The corresponding feature is called *Outputs* in [Google's Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/configuration/expose-information-outputs). Any Outputs defined in templates are going to end up as output variables in Cloud Application Manager.

```
outputs:
- name: internalIP
  value: $(ref.\{{name}}-vm.networkInterfaces[0].networkIP)
- name: ip
  value: $(ref.\{{name}}-vm.networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP)
- name: port
  value: 80
```

### Resources Deployed

The resources that have been created by the deployment are going to populate the *Resources* tab of the Instance, and will be deleted when the instance is terminated.

![Resources deployed with Google Deployment Manager](../../images/cloud-application-manager/google-deployment-manager/resources.png)

### Sample Template

The following template deploys a single virtual machine instance with a firewall rule.

To use this template in a Template Box, you need to define a mandatory variable named `machineType` with value of a valid
Google Compute Engine virtual [machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types).
Here are some possible values to define it as an Option type variable: `f1-micro,g1-small,n1-standard-1`

**Important to note** that in the following template, the `name` property of each resource gets a derived value,
`\{{env['deployment']}}` as a prefix, which contains the deployment-ID, and therefore gets a new distinct value
each time a new Instance is deployed. If we used static names for the resources, a second deployed Instance
would update the already existing resource, instead of creating a new one, and would delete the only resource
when terminated, leaving the remaining Instance referring to a non-existing resource, and therefore fail to
terminate in CAM. And also bear in mind the dire threat of unintentionally deleting resources.

```
resources:
- name: \{{ env['deployment'] }}-vm
  type: compute.v1.instance
  properties:
    zone: \{{ properties["zone"] }}
    machineType: projects/\{{ env["project"] }}/zones/\{{ properties["zone"] }}/machineTypes/\{{ properties["machineType"] }}
    disks:
    - deviceName: boot
      type: PERSISTENT
      boot: true
      autoDelete: true
      initializeParams:
        sourceImage: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
    networkInterfaces:
    - network: global/networks/default
      accessConfigs:
      - name: External NAT
        type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
    metadata:
      items:
      - key: startup-script
        value: |
          #!/bin/bash -e
          apt update && apt -y install nginx-light
    tags:
      items:
      - \{{ name }}-tcp-80
- name: \{{ env['deployment'] }}-tcp-80
  type: compute.v1.firewall
  properties:
    allowed:
    - IPProtocol: TCP
      ports:
      - '80'
    network: global/networks/default
    sourceRanges:
    - 0.0.0.0/0
    targetTags:
    - \{{name}}-tcp-80

outputs:
- name: internalIP
  value: $(ref.\{{ env['deployment'] }}-vm.networkInterfaces[0].networkIP)
- name: ip
  value: $(ref.\{{ env['deployment'] }}-vm.networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP)
- name: port
  value: 80
```

This template defines `internalIP`, `ip` and `port` output variables. You can check their output value in the Lifecycle Editor
of the deployed Instance.

#### To deploy this template

1. Create a new Provider with your Google credentials, or *Sync* your existing provider
   (only need to do once if you have never used Deployment Manager with this Provider before)
2. Create a Deployment Policy Box of *Google Deployment* type
3. Create a Template Box of *Google Deployment Template* type
4. Create a Box variable called `machineType` of *Options* type, *required*, list of *values* as `f1-micro,g1-small,n1-standard-1`
5. Create and edit an empty template for the Box, and copy the template from above
6. Deploy the box to get an Instance
7. If all goes well, check out the *Lifecycle Editor* (for output variables) and the *Resources* tab (for list of deployed resources).

Consult Google's [Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/configuration/) documentation
to learn more about deployment templates.
