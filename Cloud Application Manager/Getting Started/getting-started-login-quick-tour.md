**How to log in?**

You have a few options:

### Quick Tour

When you log in, the top navigation bar guides you to the main areas of Cloud Application Manager.

* Dashboard
* Workspaces
* Instances
* Boxes
* Providers
* Catalog
* Activity
* Your Account
* Help

**Dashboard**

![getting-started-login-8.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/getting-started-login-8.png)

It is a global vision of the content and uses of the workspace. There you can see the number of the instances, boxes or providers and their status. In addition, there are two charts with the uses by day, week or month.

**Workspaces**

![getting-started-login-2.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/getting-started-login-2.png)

When you log in, you’re in your personal workspace. From the workspace drop-down, you can access team workspaces if you belong to them, or create one and add others to share Cloud Application Manager assets and collaborate. To learn more, see [Workspaces & Sharing](../Core Concepts/workspaces-and-collaboration.md).

___

**Instances**

![getting-started-login-3.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/getting-started-login-3.png)

* Click **New** to launch instances of boxes to a provider environment in the public or private cloud.
* Manage instances you’ve [launched](../Deploying Anywhere/deploying-managing-instances.md) through the web interface, the API, or on [any infrastructure using the Cloud Application Manager agent](../Deploying Anywhere/deploying-on-anyinfra.md). Here you can quickly [manage the lifecycle](../Deploying Anywhere/deploying-managing-instances.md) of several instances from the Bulk Actions menu or handle them individually from the gear menu.
* Find an instance by searching any part of its name, or click filtered views of instances you launched or that were shared with you. Or locate them by tags.

___

**Boxes**

The Boxes page shows everything you create including boxes shared with you.

![getting-started-login-4.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/getting-started-login-4.png)

* Click **New** to create a box. Automate configuration by selecting a box type: Script, Deployment Policy, CloudFormation, Container.
* Cloud Application Manager provides a public service box catalog, which you find when you filter by the public tag. Public boxes are available to all users. These are pre-configured, which means you can directly deploy or nest them in other boxes. Since they’re publicly available to everyone, you can’t modify their configuration, but you can pass your own parameters before deploying. Examples of public boxes include MongoDB, Puppet, Chef Solo, Rails, Redis, RabbitMQ, WordPress among others.
   **Note**: Some public boxes require an Internet connection to install software. So if you’re using Cloud Application Manager as an appliance in your private datacenter without Internet access, these boxes will not deploy.
* Organize boxes as icons or as a list. Sort alphabetically by name, most recently viewed, or by the owner.
* Search for a box by name, owner, or filter by technology under Requirements. The owner is a user or a workspace.

___

**Providers**

![getting-started-login-5.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/getting-started-login-5.png)

* Connect to a provider to orchestrate deployments. Click **New** to add AWS, Azure, vSphere, Google Cloud, OpenStack, or CloudStack.
* Locate a provider through search or by type.
* Sync or delete provider accounts using Bulk Actions.

___

**Catalog**

![getting-started-login-9.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/getting-started-login-9.png)

* Shows you all the public boxes available for all users, categorized as **Featured, Managed Services, Services, Plugins** and **Other** to easily locate and deploy. 
* There is a feature where you can request to publish one of your own boxes to the catalog. It will become available in the catalog for any user in one of the existing categories or a new one.


___

**Activity**

![getting-started-login-10.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/getting-started-login-10.png)

* Allows you to see (based on your scope and permissions) all of the relevant activity that has occured in the platform, the type of event and the user that performed the event.
* Filter through activity by type of event or switch between all activity or current scope.
* Search by user name or action to narrow the results, or click on certain actions to navigate to the affected resource.

![getting-started-login-6.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/getting-started-login-6.png)

For issues related to API calls, send the request body along with details related to the issue.

In the case of a box error, share the box in the workspace that your organization and Cloud Application Manager can access and attach the logs.
* Linux: SSH and locate the log at /var/log/elasticbox/elasticbox-agent.log
* Windows: RDP into the instance to locate the log at ProgramDataElasticBoxLogselasticbox-agent.log
