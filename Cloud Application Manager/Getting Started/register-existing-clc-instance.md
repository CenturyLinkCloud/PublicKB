### Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to import an existing VM instance that was auto-discovered in your CenturyLink Cloud provider using [Cloud Application Manager](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager).

### Find a CenturyLink Cloud Windows Instance

Within the Cloud Application Manager workspace, navigate to your CenturyLink Cloud provider and run the sync function by clicking **Sync**.

The sync process will discover unregistered CenturyLink Cloud instances and list them under the **Unregistered Instances** tab.
