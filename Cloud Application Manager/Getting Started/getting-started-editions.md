With the Enterprise Edition, you get an organization of unlimited users with differing access levels to build, deploy, and manage applications collaboratively. You also get administrative level reporting and monitoring capabilities.

Specifically, the Enterprise Edition exclusively offers several cool features.

* Use Cloud Application Manager as a SaaS platform or as a virtual appliance in your private cloud.
* In addition to public clouds, deploy in private clouds like [vSphere](../Deploying Anywhere/using-the-vmware-vcenter-private-datacenter.md), [OpenStack](../Deploying Anywhere/using-openstack-cloud.md), and [CloudStack](../Deploying Anywhere/using-cloudstack.md).
* Get [sharing and collaboration features](../Core Concepts/workspaces-and-collaboration.md) to let users share providers, boxes, and instances with each other as they work on applications in shared workspaces.
* [Administer Cloud Application Manager](../Administering Your Organization/admin-overview.md) to complement your IT application management workflows. Manage all users and assets centrally, and monitor and report on resource usage.
* Manage deployments org-wide through [tagging](../Administering Your Organization/resource-tags.md), [webhooks](../Administering Your Organization/webhooks.md) that integrate with custom IPAM or CMDB solutions, or admin boxes that let you make sure deployments consistently comply with company policies.
