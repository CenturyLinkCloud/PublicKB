### Overview

This tutorial is meant to assist users of Cloud Application Manager to learn how to use [ebcli](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ebcli) - our command line tool- to control their Cloud Application Manager account as follows:

* For **boxes** - how to deploy, export, import as version or as a draft, etc using ebcli.
* For **instances** - how to reconfigure, reinstall, shutdown, poweron, export, etc using ebcli.
* For **ECS images** - how to manage them using ebcli.
* For **workspaces** - how to list them using ebcli.

ebcli calls Cloud Application Manager APIs in the backend to list, provision and manage the lifecycle of your workloads based on the box configuration.

### Audience

All Cloud Application Manager users who want to control their Cloud Application Manager account using `ebcli` - command line tool.

### Prerequisites

* Access to Cloud Application Manager [Site](https://cam.ctl.io/#/login) or to an on-premises Cloud Application Manager Dedicated Edition (CAM appliance).
* The user must have an existing account to login into using username and password or his preferred authentication mechanism.

### Installation of ebcli command line tool

Before you start using `ebcli`, you need to install it using `pip` which is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like.

If you don't have `pip` installed. Please follow this guide to install it into your computer: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

**Terminal Command**

Open a terminal in your computer and execute the installation command:

```
pip install ebcli
```

When the installation process ends pip should have installed ebcli and all of its required dependencies.

### Login into your Cloud Application Manager account with ebcli

Before you can control your Cloud Application Manager account with ebcli, you need to connect your account in Cloud Application Manager with ebcli.

The ebcli needs a token to login into your Cloud Application Manager account.

**Steps to create a token**

* Open https://cam.ctl.io if you are using SaaS or https://YOUR_APPLIANCE_FQDN if you are using on premises edition of Cloud Application Manager
* Login with your username and password or your preferred authentication mechanism
* Click on your user name menu (at top right corner of CAM user interface)
* Click on 'Authentication Tokens'
* Write a descriptive name for your token, i.e. ebcli
* Click on 'Create Token'
* Click on clipboard buttom at right of your token to copy it

**Terminal Command**

Open a terminal in your computer and execute the login command:

```
ebcli login
```

You will be prompt for introduccing your 'Authentication Token:', just paste your token, and hit Enter.

Now your computer will ask your keyring password to store your Cloud Application Manager token safely in your keyring.

#### Terminate an Instance

Use ebcli to execute terminate operation on an instance which is provisioned.

**WARNING - This is a destructive operation**

***You can't connect to, restart or recover an instance after you've terminated it.***

Before you terminate the instance, verify that you won't lose any data by checking that your volumes won't be deleted on termination and that you've copied any data that you need from your instance volumes to a persistent storage service.

When an instance terminates, the data on any instance store and volumes associated with that instance are deleted.

When you terminate an instance, the whole history of the instance is kept in Cloud Application Manager and you can use it as a reference for other instances, to copy the variables or to clone the instance. The instance in your cloud provider is terminated or deprovisioned.

After you terminate an instance, it remains visible in your cloud provider console for a short period of time, and then the entry is automatically deleted. After an instance is terminated, resources such as tags and volumes are gradually disassociated from the instance.

```
ebcli terminate ”<instance-id>”
```

|-------------------|-------------|
