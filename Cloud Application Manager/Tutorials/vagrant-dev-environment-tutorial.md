### Set up a Development Environment Using Cloud Application Manager and Vagrant

In this 90-minute walkthrough, learn how to launch production-ready development and test environments from boxes on to your laptop using the [Cloud Application Manager agent](../Deploying Anywhere/deploying-on-anyinfra.md). With boxes, you can launch development environments in the same way as production letting developers test changes realistically.

**Scenario**

We’re going to define a Rails development environment in boxes and launch them using the Cloud Application Manager agent on to your Mac laptop running a virtual machine on Vagrant and VirtualBox. The environment is based on a sample Ruby on Rails app that uses MySQL as a database.

**Learning Objectives**

This tutorial helps you learn these concepts:

* Define any module or application in boxes. If some part of the environment changes in the future, you don’t have to change every developer’s laptop, only the box for example.
* Spin up applications from boxes on to any infrastructure like your laptop using the Cloud Application Manager agent Linux Bash script.
* Work with Cloud Application Manager and Vagrant to launch local environments. Run applications inside a virtual machine to isolate and protect your laptop from a different OS and runtime.

**Let’s get started:**
* Before you begin
* Define dev environment in boxes
* Launch dev environment using the Cloud Application Manager agent
* Verify dev environment

### Before you begin

To get started, set up the following:

1. Sign up for a Cloud Application Manager account.

2. Fork a sample Rails app from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app_rails_4). Clone it in your Mac laptop as shown. This creates a local copy of the sample Rails app.

    ![tutorial-vagrant-1-2.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/tutorial-vagrant-1-2.png)

3. Install VirtualBox, a free open source virtualizer to run your dev environment. To install, run this command in your Mac laptop terminal:

   ```
   brew cask install virtualbox
   ```

4. [Install Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/) on your Mac laptop to isolate your development environment in VirtualBox:

    ```
    brew cask install vagrant
    ```

5. Install a Vagrant Ubuntu 14.04 Linux image:

    ```
    vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64 https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64
    ```

6. Create a Vagrantfile that we’ll use later to provision the image:

    ```
    vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
    ```

### Define Dev Environment in Boxes

We log in to Cloud Application Manager and define modules of the Rails dev environment in multiple [boxes](../Core Concepts/boxes.md) and stack them into a single box at the end.

**Nodejs Box**

This installs Javascript runtime for the Rails app.

**Steps**

1. Create a new box called Nodejs based on Linux Compute.

2. Add an options variable called APT_GET_UPDATE with a **no** value.

![tutorial-vagrant-1-3.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/tutorial-vagrant-1-3.png)

3. Copy/paste this script in a **install** event:

![tutorial-vagrant-1-4.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/tutorial-vagrant-1-4.png)

    ```
    #!/bin/bash

    \{{ 'apt-get update' if APT_GET_UPDATE == 'yes' }}
    apt-get -q -y install nodejs

    ```

![tutorial-vagrant-2.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/tutorial-vagrant-2.png)

**Rails Dependencies Box**

This installs all the dependencies for the Rails app.

**Steps**

1. Create a new box called Rails Dependencies based on Linux Compute.

2. Add the following variables:
    * Port variable called http set to **3000**.
    * Box variable called ruby pointing to the default **Ruby** box.
    * Box variable called nodejs pointing to the **Nodejs** box.

### Launch Dev Environment Using the Cloud Application Manager Agent


Launch the Rails Dev Env box on your Mac laptop virtual machine running on Vagrant and VirtualBox as follows.

**Steps**

1. Search for the Vagrantfile on your Mac laptop. Open and replace contents with these lines. They ask Vagrant to provision the Linux Ubuntu image with the Rails Dev Env box using the agent script:

    **IMPORTANT**: Replace the token in the -t flag with your own authentication token.

    ```
    # -*- mode: ruby -*-
    # vi: set ft=ruby :

    # Vagrantfile API/syntax version. Don't touch unless you know what you're doing!
    VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"

    Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
    # All Vagrant configuration is done here. The most common configuration
    # options are documented and commented below. For a complete reference,
    # please see the online documentation at vagrantup.com.

    # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.
    config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3000, host: 3100
    config.vm.provision :shell, inline: 'curl -sSL https://cam.ctl.io | sudo bash -s -- -b "Rails Dev Env" -n laptop -t 04329c63-78b7-4313-bc09-8090e3a7e93d'

    end
    ```

2. Move the Vagrantfile to the sample_app_rails_4 folder cloned in your Mac laptop. Commit and push this change to your forked repo in GitHub.

    ![tutorial-vagrant-7.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/tutorial-vagrant-7.png)

3. In your Mac laptop terminal, go to the sample_app_rails_4 directory as in this example:

    ```
    cd /Users/cristina/sample_app_rails_4
    ```

4. Bring up the Vagrant Ubuntu image in VirtualBox and launch the Rails dev environment with this command:

    ```
    vagrant up
    ```

    Right away, the box is provisioned per the Vagrantfile and it soon registers in Cloud Application Manager. Check your Cloud Application Manager workspace for the online Rails Dev Env instance. This can take a few minutes.

    ![tutorial-vagrant-8.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/tutorial-vagrant-8.png)

5. Once online, from the instance **Endpoints** tab, copy the Rails app IP address.

    ![tutorial-vagrant-9.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/tutorial-vagrant-9.png)

6. In your Mac laptop terminal, SSH into your Vagrant virtual machine from the sample_app_rails_4 directory:

    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```

7. Open the Rails app in the virtual machine using xdg-open. If you don’t have xdg-utils, install it first as shown.

    ```
    sudo apt install xdg-utils
    ```

    ```
    xdg-open
    ```

    ![tutorial-vagrant-10.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/tutorial-vagrant-10.png)

### Verify Dev Environment

Let’s now run some tests to verify that the dev environment is working.

**Steps**

1. Open a new terminal in your Mac laptop and go to the sample_app_rails_4 directory.

2. SSH into the virtual machine:

    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```

3. Go to this vagrant directory:

    ```
    cd /vagrant
    ```

4. Migrate Rails tests as follows:

    ```
    bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
    ```

5. Finally, run tests with this command:

    ```
    rspec spec
    ```

You should see all the tests pass. Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed a Rails development environment on your laptop using Cloud Application Manager and Vagrant.

![tutorial-vagrant-11.png](../../images/cloud-application-manager/tutorial-vagrant-11.png)

To quit the Vagrant virtual environment, run this command:

```
exit
```

After completing the tutorial, be sure to terminate the instance in your Cloud Application Manager workspace by selecting the gear icon and clicking **Terminate**. Then delete the Vagrant virtual machine with this command:

```
vagrant destroy
```
