### Overview

When you sign up for the Cloud Application Manager Enterprise Edition, you get a default administrator account that lets you globally manage settings for all Cloud Application Manager users in your organization. Besides the default account, you can give any Cloud Application Manager user administrator access through the admin console under Organization > Administrators.

### Audience

All users with Cloud Application Manager organization administrator access.

### Prerequisites

* Access to Cloud Application Manager, [Management site](https://account.cam.ctl.io/#/settings).
* The user must be an Administrator of the organization in Cloud Application Manager.
* The user should be at the organization level scope to access the Settings option in the left side menu, or through the pencil button in the organization element in the context switcher.


### To Give Admin Access
1. Log in to Cloud Application Manager as the default administrator.
2. Access to the context switcher drop-down located in the top navigation menu, open it and click on **Organizations**.

To revoke administrator privileges for a user, click X against their name under **Administrators**.

Administrators can manage several org-wide settings that include [user authentication](user-authentication.md), the [Cloud Application Manager appliance](../Appliance/appliance-overview.md), [provider access](provider-access.md), [admin boxes](../Automating Deployments/deploymentpolicy-box.md), [webhooks](webhooks.md), and [instance tags](resource-tags.md). To get a good idea of things you can do, see [Overview](admin-overview.md).
