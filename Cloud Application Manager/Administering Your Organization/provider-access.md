### Overview

By default, all public and private cloud providers are enabled for Cloud Application Manager users. As a Cloud Application Manager administrator, you can enable or disable providers for the entire organization in the [admin console](admin-overview.md), so turning off a particular provider is possible if you don’t want people to deploy to it.

### Audience

All users with Cloud Application Manager organization administrator access.

### Prerequisites

* Access to Cloud Application Manager, [Management site](https://account.cam.ctl.io/#/settings).
  
* The user must be an Administrator of the organization in Cloud Application Manager.
  
* The user should be at the organization level scope to access the **Settings** option on the left side menu. Accessing that option is also possible through the pencil button of an organization element in the Context Switcher.

### Enable Provider Access

Enabling provider access does not automatically register providers for use but determines which ones users can connect and deploy to.

In the admin console, you can control access under **Clouds**.
