### Overview
The following process automates the configuration of your AWS account for Cloud Application Manager Analytics functionality by using native AWS CloudFormation functionality. You can inspect the code snippet [here](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ctl-cloudoptimization/CTLCloudOptimizationIAMPolicy.template.json).

If you prefer to set-up your environment manually, you can find those setup instructions [here](CloudApplicationManagerAnalyticsAWSSetup-Manual.md).
