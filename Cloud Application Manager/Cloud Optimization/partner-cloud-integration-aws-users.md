### Overview

Cloud Application Manager is a wonderful tool for addressing many customers' needs. Regardless, a user may still want to log into portal.azure.com from occasionally to modify resources there.

### Audience

All of our customers are invited to use Cloud Integration.

### Prerequisites

Knowledge of Cloud Application Manager's [partner cloud integration](partner-cloud-integration.md) feature.

An existing [Microsoft Azure Provider created by Cloud Application Manager](partner-cloud-integration-azure-new.md).

### Important Information

To obtain a user, please submit a support request via the following method:

* Email incident@CenturyLink.com

Our operations staff will confirm your identity according to protocol.
Within the request, please provide the list of users who require Access and a secure, quick method for CenturyLink to provide temporary passwords. We will deliver the credentials only to the person who made the request.

Once you have the user, navigate to https://portal.azure.com/. If you automatically sign into a portal without being asked for your credentials, that can be confusing. You are likely already logged into another Microsoft account. Sign out of the account, navigate back to https://portal.azure.com/, and try again.

All users will be given CenturyLink's [customized set of Azure permissions](partner-cloud-integration-azure-capabilities.md).
