### Overview

Partner Cloud Integration allows an Cloud Application Manager user to create AWS Customer Accounts for which CenturyLink will provide Platform-level support. The following is a description of what platform-level support is and how to use it.

### Audience

All of our customers are invited to use Cloud Optimization via Cloud Application Manager.

### Prerequisites

Knowledge of Cloud Application Manager's [Cloud Optimization](partner-cloud-integration.md) feature.

Knowledge of how to [get started with Optimized Amazon Web Services](partner-cloud-integration-aws-new.md)

### Important Information

For existing accounts moving under our care you may be required to change your accounts' Support plans. You must sign in with root account credentials (email address and password) to change your support plan to Enterprise Support. The cost of the support plan does not appear on your consolidated bill, but it is required so that CenturyLink may meet our Service Level Objectives and use our automated tools. In addition, Amazon Web Services requires it so that proper prioritization is given to any platform-level issues that may need to be addressed. Please review [get Started With an existing AWS Customer Account](partner-cloud-integration-aws-existing.md))

CenturyLink recommends Customers utilize vendor-supported Operating Systems such as Microsoft Windows and RedHat Linux. Neither your company, CenturyLink nor our cloud partners can obtain vendor support on free Operating Systems.
