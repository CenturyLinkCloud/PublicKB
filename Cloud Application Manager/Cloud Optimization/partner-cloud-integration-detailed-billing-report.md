### Overview

Optimizing Accounts allows a Cloud Application Manager user to receive [consolidated bills](partner-cloud-integration-consolidated-billing.md). To get further details for these invoices, users may review the billing history.

### Audience

All users with Cloud Application Manager organization administrator access.

### Prerequisites

At least one Optimized account.

Cloud Application Manager organization administrator access.


### Important Information

Starting January 1, 2018 data will be available according to the following methods for December 2017 usage, going forward. November reconciliation SKUs (labeled "Update to Previous Month...") which appear on the December invoice will not have any detail. If you need detailed information for those prior months, please submit a support ticket.

To gain access to the information, navigate to the billing history within Cloud Application Manager by switching your context to an organization. Then select "Billing", then "Usage History."

 Details of how CenturyLink safeguards customer accounts so they are billed fairly is also represented. If a Reserved Instance is purchased in one account and assigned by Amazon Web Services to a different account, CenturyLink will perform inter-customer adjustments. The RI-purchasing account will be credited and the RI-consuming account will be debited.
