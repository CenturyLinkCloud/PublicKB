### Overview

CenturyLink's goal is to continually expand the Azure products and services we support.  This article provides a definitive list of the capabilities available today on Azure when using Cloud Application Manager. CenturyLink will provide a [custom role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-custom-roles) to the Cloud Application Manager application and to any users who submit a request for portal.azure.com credentials.

### CenturyLink Capabilities for Azure

All Permissions, shown below, either represent an Azure action or a Category of actions (which Microsoft calls a Resource Provider). All Resource Providers or actions listed have full Read, Write, Delete operations unless otherwise stated or unless the available operations are unique or limited (one or two of the actions Read, Write, or Delete are not available). If operations are unique or limited, they will still be provided to their fullest extent if they are listed.
