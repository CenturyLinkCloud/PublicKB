### Overview

Partner Cloud Integration allows an Cloud Application Manager user to create Microsoft Azure Customer Accounts or transfer an existing one into CenturyLink's care. If you want to stop usage and completely shut down that Azure Customer Account, you must do more than delete the provider in Cloud Application Manager. You will also need to tell CenturyLink to turn off the actual Azure account via a CTL support ticket and CTL will assist to make sure the account is removed properly.  Not following this process could cause unexpected billing charges to continue.

### Audience
