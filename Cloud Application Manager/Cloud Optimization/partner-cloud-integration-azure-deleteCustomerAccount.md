### Overview

Partner Cloud Integration allows an Cloud Application Manager user to create Microsoft Azure Customer Accounts or transfer an existing one into Lumen's care. If you want to stop usage and completely shut down that Azure Customer Account, you must do more than delete the provider in Cloud Application Manager. You will also need to tell Lumen to turn off the actual Azure account via a LUMEN support ticket and LUMEN will assist to make sure the account is removed properly.  Not following this process could cause unexpected billing charges to continue.

### Audience

All Cloud Application Manager Customers with ARM Providers supported by Lumen

### Prerequisites

You will need to have followed optimized a Microsoft Azure customer account at some point already.

You will need to delete the associated Azure provider at some point, before or after submitting the request described below.
