### Overview
This article describes the process of moving an existing AWS billing account over to CenturyLink billing or from an existing third-party partner billing account to CenturyLink billing.

### Description
CenturyLink Cloud Application Manager is an application and infrastructure management platform with CenturyLink integrated Managed Services delivered via automation. Cloud Application Manager enables IT organizations to manage workloads across any infrastructure environment efficiently while optimizing third-party cloud services for cost and performance.

### Audience
* Customers with an existing AWS account.
* Customers with an existing CenturyLink Cloud account.

### Prerequisite
The Managed Hosting services should make up 30% of the existing resale revenue of AWS. These services may come from any of the following areas:
* Cloud Application Manager – Application Lifecycle Management
* Cloud Application Manager – Managed Services Anywhere
* Managed Services – Managed Applications
* Managed Services – Advanced Services
* Other packaged or custom offerings within Managed Services
* Service Management
* ITS Consulting – Migration, Cloud or Application Assessments, AWS Service Provisioning

These services must be attached on top of the specific AWS services you want to transition through the process, for Example: AWS Account = $100,000. Required CenturyLink Services (from the list above) = minimum of $30,000.

AWS expects to see these services in the Value Plan document for approval. Documentation will be reviewed to ensure these services are attached appropriately.

### Steps in the Process
Any time large accounts are shifted between service providers in the AWS Partner Network, AWS wants to understand the business case for ensuring good customer outcomes, and how the new APN member will be adding value to the end customer’s use of AWS.

**Register the Opportunity**
1. Create the opportunity in [Salesforce](http://qcentral.qwest.net/portal/site/qcentral/index.jsp?epi-content=LOGIN&SFA=true) and use **Savvis** as the Record Type.
   * Note: When the opportunity is for CAM being added to an existing AWS cloud service product, the selection should be Cloud Application Manager 1.0.

2. Include the following details in the Opportunity.
   * Designate if it is an existing account and note how many master payer accounts and sub-accounts.
   * Estimate and note how much spend is currently projected in the existing accounts.
   * Estimate and note how much Cloud Application Manager service consumption will occur (ALM – Application Lifecycle Management and MSA – Managed Services Anywhere).
   * Designate if other CenturyLink Managed Services will be used. If so, which ones and how much.
   * Designate if other CenturyLink IT Consulting Services are positioned. If so, which and how much.
   * Designate how much AWS growth is expected above the existing spend.

3. Download and complete the [Value-Add Plan](https://cloudhelp.ctl.io/knowledge-base/aws-share-shift-value-add-plan/). Be sure to include the following key information:
   * Specific account numbers (master payers and sub accounts) to be moved.
   * Size of the deal.
   * Specific CenturyLink managed services being adding on top of AWS services.
   * Reason for account move.
   * Growth opportunity (including $$ value).

   * **Note**: No bookings, pricing, or quoting can occur until after approval addendum has been received back from AWS.

**Submit the Value-Add Plan**
1. Access the [AWS APN Portal](https://www.apn-portal.com/home/home.jsp) and click **New Opportunity**.
2. Attach the Value-Added Plan in the APN portal and send the email to AWS. This launches an AWS Internal Evaluation Process. **Note**: The process may take between 1 and 4 weeks to complete, depending on the size of the deal and the strategic value of the account.
   * AWS evaluates the opportunities and informs the existing AWS account teams.
   * Addendums are signed between the customer and AWS.
   * Approval addendums are emailed with attachments back to CenturyLink.
   * If AWS does not approve the deal, only Greenfield accounts can be created.

**Coordinate Follow-UP**
1. Distribute the Approval or Denial notification to CenturyLink Account Team.
   * Cloud Help Deal Team coordinate between the Sales Team, AWS account team, and Solution Architects (SA) for strategizing on the account.

2. In the **Booking Method** field, select **Two-Bill Copy**.
   * Include all specific Master Payer accounts and sub-accounts shifted from AWS in the request.
   * All account numbers must match what has been represented on the two previous bills used in the “2-Bill Booking Method” steps.  They must also be associated with the approved AWS accounts.
   * **Note**: The compensation and booking method are determined only by the accounts and values submitted which can be verified. The accounts and sub-accounts **must** match on the bill and the projected MRC in the order.
   * These attachments/account numbers and values **must** be included in the set of documents that the customer signs. These should also be included in what POM reviews as well.

3. Click **Submit Booking Guidelines** for approval.
   * The Bookings team receives an email once and the opportunity is locked.
   * The Booking team reviews and approves or denies.
