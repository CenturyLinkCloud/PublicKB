### Overview

With Microsoft Azure, you may find that some products which should be immediately deployable are not. Microsoft Azure has a concept of registering for some resources, while others are registered by default. There are even times when you may need to re-register these resources.  

### Audience
Users of Microsoft Azure.

### Prerequisites
An active, Microsoft Azure Subscription.

### Important Information
For your subscription, go to Resource Providers. Look at the list of resource providers, and if necessary, select the Re-register link to re-register the resource provider of the type you are trying to deploy.
