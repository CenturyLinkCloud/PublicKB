### Overview

[Cloud Application Manager](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/) offers the Cloud Integration feature, giving users the ability to benefit from Lumen's partnerships with other cloud providers. Lumen integrates the billing and assumes responsibility for Google support. This document is specific to GCP.


### Audience

For Google Cloud Platform, see our [Service Guide](https://www.ctl.io/legal/cloud-application-manager/supplemental-terms/) for a current list of countries we support. Also, this offering is not for Lumen employees. If you need special considerations for setting up an account, please email request@centurylink.com.

### Prerequisites

* Access to Cloud Application Manager.

* The user must be an Administrator of the organization in Cloud Application Manager.

* A working knowledge of how to use [Cloud Application Manager providers](../Core Concepts/providers.md).

* An understanding of the features and benefits of [Partner Cloud Integration](partner-cloud-integration.md)

* For each Lumen Cloud account integrated with GCP, both Lumen's and Google's Terms and Conditions must be accepted. These will be presented to any user attempting to create a new "Google Compute" provider in Cloud Application Manager. See our [Service Guide](https://www.ctl.io/legal/cloud-application-manager/supplemental-terms/) for a current list of countries we support.

### Important Information

Charges for [Google usage](partner-cloud-integration-consolidated-billing.md) will appear on invoices from Lumen.

3. Select New
4. In the Provider drop-down, select "Google Compute"
5. Write a name for the provider.

7. Accept the Terms and Conditions
Please expect at least a few hours before we are able to process your request.
8. Click the "Google Console" button to access your GCP account.
