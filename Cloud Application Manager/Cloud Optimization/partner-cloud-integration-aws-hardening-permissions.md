### Overview

As discussed in the [Service Guide](https://www.ctl.io/legal/cloud-application-manager/service-guide/), CenturyLink will provide billing and support functions for Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts that are integrated with Cloud Application Manager. The Service Guide provides a high-level overview of those permissions, describing the groups requiring permissions and the type of permissions they are expected to have.

### Audience

Account users that have or are considering CenturyLink Optimization of AWS Accounts. This is for all new AWS accounts created through Cloud Application Manager ("greenfield") and any existing account moving into CenturyLink's care ("brownfield").

### Prerequisites

*NOTE:* To facilitate the hardening process, the customer must enable the "CTLDeveloperRole".  Once this is enabled, the hardening process will configure the remaining roles below.

For a new AWS Account:
* The customer must have reviewed the process for creating a [new Amazon Web Services account](partner-cloud-integration-aws-new.md)

For an existing AWS Account:
* The customer must already have an AWS account that has been specifically mentioned in the AWS account transfer process. (Only approved accounts are authorized for this process.)
* The customer must have reviewed the process for transferring an [existing Amazon Web Services account](partner-cloud-integration-aws-existing.md)


### Important Information

#### Root Level Access

CenturyLink does not provide root level access for any account. Root access should be avoided unless absolutely necessary for both Master Payer accounts owned by CenturyLink and any linked account owned by the customer.

Customers with existing accounts are asked to deliver root account credentials to CenturyLink per the Service Guide. This includes root email, root password, and MFAâ€™s secret configuration key. You may continue to use your IAM credentials.

For Master Payers and new accounts created through Cloud Application Manager, MFA access is set up after account configuration is complete. The key is kept in an encrypted vault within a domain separated from the main CenturyLink domain.


#### Federated access
All roles described below &mdash; except for the Customer Admin &mdash; maintain a trust with CenturyLink accounts. This allows access to customer accounts to certain CenturyLink users and automated tools, which inherit the permissions and restrictions described with the roles below.

#### IAM Access
The following categories explain how CenturyLink automatically provides or restricts user access.

All policies summarized in this document result from intensive consultation with AWS MSP specialists, and are designed to be in accordance with partner requirements and suggested best practices. All policies have been reviewed and approved by the vendor and third-party auditors.

#### Hardening, Re-Hardening, Overrides, and Exceptions
The following IAM hardening roles and policies are applied at the time the account is integrated with Cloud Application Manager. Additionally, CenturyLink will occasionally re-apply these policies. The entire process is applied to any integrated account to which CAM still has administrative rights. Any deviations from the standard will be overwritten except where there are overrides or customizations.

Overrides can be be performed by customer users with appropriate permissions or by CenturyLink Support Staff. Where the CAMOverridePolicy and CAMOpsOverridePolicy are used, users may modify permissions of CAM, Admin Users, and CenturyLink CenturyLink Support Staff via the AWS IAM Console. These policies will not be overwritten when account hardening is re-applied. Please be aware that these polices may be applied to several roles.

Change Requests may result in exceptions to hardening. Please read the "Change Request" sections below. If you submit one and it is accepted, CAM will not be able to overwrite those changes as a result of future hardening attempts.


**Customer Admin User / Group**
* **IAM GroupName**: `yourCompanyName`Group
* **Admin User's IAM Name**: `yourCompanyName`Admin
* **Attached Policy Names**: CTLCustomerPolicy, AdministratorAccess
* **Targeted groups/tools/users**: The first Administrator who created a new AWS account via Cloud Application Manager, plus any further users placed in that group.
* **Intent**: To be able to provide the first administrator as many permissions as possible so that they can begin to set up the new account.
* **Change Requests**: The policies will be applied by default to this group for any new accounts created by CenturyLink. If you would like  to add further restrictions to the group and the users it contains, the customer retains all permissions to do so.
* **Policy Summary**
- Restricts the ability to link or unlink from an organization.
- Restricts deleting CenturyLink-defined IAM policies, roles and additional sundry functions (such as MFA/SAML deletion).
- Billing/Usage/Budgeting aspects of the portal are restricted to prevent confusion due to CenturyLink consolidated billing. (Integrated accounts have access to this data through Cloud Application Manager's Analytics tools.)
- Full administrator access to all other aspects of the account which are not restricted by other policies.



**Customer Role**
* **Role Name**: CTLCustomerRole
* **Attached Policy Names**: CTLCustomerPolicy
* **Targeted groups/tools/users**: Any customer user. This policy is applied to all customer IAM Groups.
* **Intent**: To be added to existing customer IAM groups or given to new customer groups. This policy allows the user to manipulate all services within AWS, but restricts certain views and actions that would confuse or cause conflict in an Integrated account.
* **Change Requests**: This will be applied by default, but CenturyLink can work with you to ensure that the policy does not impact existing functionality. If there are any concerns or desired exceptions regarding these policies, please submit a ticket and one of our Product Team members will be glad to discuss it with you.
* **Policy Summary**
  - Restricts the ability to link or unlink from an organization.
  - Restricts deleting CenturyLink-defined IAM policies, roles and additional sundry functions (such as MFA/SAML deletion).
  - Billing/Usage/Budgeting aspects of the portal are restricted to prevent confusion due to CenturyLink consolidated billing. (Integrated accounts have access to this data through Cloud Application Manager's Analytics tools.)

**CenturyLink Operations Role**
* **Role Name**: CTLOperationsRole
* **Attached Policy Names**: ReadOnlyAccess, CTLOperationsPolicy, CAMOpsOverridePolicy
* **Targeted groups/tools/users**: CenturyLink Support Staff and tools
* **Intent**: To allow Operations rights of least privilege, with flexibility
* **Change Requests**: Both the customer and Operations can modify CAMOpsOverridePolicy to change permissions and restrictions of Operations
* **Policy Summary**
  - ReadOnlyAccess: Allows ReadOnlyAccess
  - CTLOperationsPolicy: Allows ability to create and update most IAM concepts while preventing them from making changes to other IAM dependencies of CAM.
  - CAMOpsOverridePolicy: See "Hardening, Re-Hardening, Overrides, and Exceptions" above.


**CenturyLink Developer Role**
* **Role Name**: CTLDeveloperRole
* **Attached Policy Names**: CTLDeveloperPolicy
* **Targeted groups/tools/users**:Cloud Application Manager's Optimization tool. A limited number of CenturyLink developers have access to the tool.
* **Intent**: The Optimization tool should be able to configure customer accounts, affect IAM permissions, and swiftly remediate any issues.
* **Change Requests**: Because CenturyLink must maintain administrative access, no changes can be made at this time. Please see the [Service Guide](https://www.ctl.io/legal/cloud-application-manager/service-guide/) for details.
* **Policy Summary**:
  - Full access

**CenturyLink Lambda Role**
* **Role Name**: CTLAccountControlsLambdaRole
* **Attached Policy Names**: CTLAccountControlsLambdaPolicy
* **Targeted groups/tools/users**: Newly created IAM users that are not in IAM Groups
* **Intent**: Our hardening applies continuous auto-remediation steps to ensure your accounts are protected. IAM users who are not placed within a group will have all their permissions removed, so it is recommended that you move all IAM users to an IAM group. Once they are placed in a group, permissions can be applied again. Newly created IAM groups will automatically have the CTLCustomerPolicy applied. These steps are taken to ensure a seamless experience between Cloud Application Manager and your AWS account. This also allows CenturyLink to ensure that your account continues to meet best practice security guidelines.
* **Change Requests**: This will be applied by default, but as this policy is intended to help, not hinder you, please contact CenturyLink with a support ticket if you find it conflicts with existing functionality.
* **Policy Summary**:
  - Full control of IAM and Config


**CenturyLink Analytics Role**
* **Role Name**: CTLCloudOptimizationRole
* **Policy Name**: CTLCloudOptimization
