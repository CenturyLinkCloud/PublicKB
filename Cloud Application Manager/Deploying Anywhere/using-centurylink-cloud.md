### Overview

Automate application deployments through Cloud Application Manager when you launch to Linux or Windows virtual servers in the CenturyLink Cloud public platform. Cloud Application Manager simplifies deployments with a dedicated focus on applications rather than infrastructure.

### Audience

All Cloud Application Manager users who want to deploy workloads into CLC.

### Prerequisites

* Access to Cloud Application Manager [Management site](https://account.cam.ctl.io/#/providers?type=CenturyLink).
* The user must have an existing CLC account or should be an Administrator of the organization in Cloud Application Manager to create or bring a CLC account to be managed by CenturyLink.

### Register CenturyLink Cloud Provider in Cloud Application Manager

You need a [CenturyLink Cloud account](//www.ctl.io/) to be able to deploy from Cloud Application Manager. When you have an account, follow these steps to register it in Cloud Application Manager to automate your deployments.

**Steps**

1. In Cloud Application Manager, go to **Providers** > **New Provider** and select **CenturyLink.**

2. Enter the CenturyLink username and password as shown and save.

### Deploy to CenturyLink Cloud from Cloud Application Manager

Select from the following deployment profile options to launch workloads on Linux or Windows machines.

Note a couple of things about instances you deploy on CenturyLink Cloud through Cloud Application Manager.

* Instance name. Each instance is assigned a name that has the format of DatacenterFirst_six_letters_of_instance_nameCounter. i.e., UC1CITTPUBLIC01 for an instance deployed on UC1 (US West - Santa Clara) of a box called Public Proxy.
* Instance Description. Depending on the number of instances you spin up through Cloud Application Manager, each instance is assigned a description that has the format of dasherized-instance-name-datacenter-service_ID-machine-number.

**Deployment**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Provider |  Select a CenturyLink Cloud account registered in Cloud Application Manager. |


**Resource**

![Resource section of deployment policy](../../images/cloud-application-manager/deployment-policy/resource-centurylink.png)

| Option | Description |

| Server Type | Select a server type, for example, standard. |
| Datacenter | Select a location to place the instance, for example, UC1. |
| Group |	Select placement group for the new instance. |
| Template | Select from a list of CenturyLink Cloud Linux or Windows images. Images are specific to the box service type, that is, Linux or Windows. |
| Instances | Specify the number of instances to provision. |
| Admin/root Password | Choose the Administrator user password for Windows instance or the root password for Linux instance. This Password can be left empty, then a random password will be generated. When specified, this password will show up in CLC portal. |
| Confirm Password | Confirm the password. |


**Network**

![Network section of deployment policy](../../images/cloud-application-manager/deployment-policy/network-centurylink.png)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Network |	Select a vLan for the new instance. |
| Public IP	| Check the box to attach a public IP address to the new instance. |

##### Proxy

![Proxy section of deployment policy](../../images/cloud-application-manager/deployment-policy/proxy-centurylink.png)

| Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Host |	The hostname or domain of the proxy that the agent will use to connect back to Cloud Application Manager, once it has been installed in the deployed instance. |
| Port |  The port of the proxy that the agent will use to connect back to Cloud Application Manager, once it has been installed in the deployed instance. |


**Compute**

![Compute section of deployment policy](../../images/cloud-application-manager/deployment-policy/compute-centurylink.png)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CPUs | Select virtual CPUs for the instance. You can get up to 16 cores. |
| Memory | Allocate RAM for the instance. You can get up to 128 GB. |

**Disks**

![Disks section of deployment policy](../../images/cloud-application-manager/deployment-policy/disk-centurylink.png)

By default, the machine is provisioned with 17GB local disk space. You can add more disks in RAW format or Partitioned, up to 1024 GB.

### Enabling services

*Services* tab is the right place where services such as [Managed Services Anywhere](../Managed Services/getting-started-with-cam-enable-managed-provider.md), [Automatic Discovery of Resources](../Getting Started/register-existing-instance.md#discovering-the-unregistered-instances) and [Analytics](../analytics/cloudapplicationmanageranalyticsui.md) can be enabled or disabled attending to your needs. Note that the number of active services will be shown next to the tab's name.

### Shutdown and Terminate Instances in CenturyLink Cloud

**Shutdown Instance**

Initiates a graceful shutdown of the corresponding server or servers. Like the “off” power command, all memory and CPU charges cease, monitors are disabled, and the machine is left in a powered off state. Any licensing charges (if applicable) and storage charges continue accruing.

More information [here](https://www.ctl.io/guides/servers/server-power-operations/).

**Terminate Instance**

The server is terminated and any disks are also deleted. The charges stop.

The history of the instance on Cloud Application Manager is preserved until the instance is deleted.

### Contacting Cloud Application Manager Support

We’re sorry you’re having an issue in [Cloud Application Manager](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/). Please review the [troubleshooting tips](../Troubleshooting/troubleshooting-tips.md), or contact [Cloud Application Manager support](mailto:incident@CenturyLink.com) with details and screenshots where possible.

For issues related to API calls, send the request body along with details related to the issue.

In the case of a box error, share the box in the workspace that your organization and Cloud Application Manager can access and attach the logs.
* Linux: SSH and locate the log at /var/log/elasticbox/elasticbox-agent.log
* Windows: RDP into the instance to locate the log at ProgramDataElasticBoxLogselasticbox-agent.log
