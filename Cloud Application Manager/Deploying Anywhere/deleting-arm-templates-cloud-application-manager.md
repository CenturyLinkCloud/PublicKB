### Introduction

[Cloud Application Manager](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/) is a scalable platform for deploying enterprise mission-critical applications across any cloud infrastructure &ndash; private, public or hosted. It provides interactive visualization to automate application provisioning, including configuration, deployment, scaling, updating and migration of applications in real-time. Cloud Application Manager manages both traditional and cloud-native applications provisioned on bare metal and virtual machines across any type of infrastructure.

### Log Into Cloud Application Manager

To get started with Cloud Application Manager, sign up for an account and register your cloud service (CenturyLink, AWS or Azure, for example) as a provider.

You can see how Cloud Application Manager seamlessly works to terminate the instance you created with an ARM template.

Once the termination process is complete, the activity page of the instance will be updated to reflect it's termination.

### Checking Termination

If you try to ssh to the instance, you will no longer be able to access it because it was instantly deleted.
