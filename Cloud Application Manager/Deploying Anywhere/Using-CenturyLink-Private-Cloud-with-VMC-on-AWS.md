### Overview

This article is meant to assist users of Cloud Application Manager to configure a CenturyLink Private Cloud with VMC on AWS provider, then deploy or register a virtual machines with it.

### Audience

All users of Cloud Application Manager using CenturyLink Private Cloud with VMC on AWS providers.

### Prerequisites

* An active *Cloud Application Manager* account
* Access and credentials to a **CenturyLink Private Cloud with VMC on AWS**.
* A virtual machine template (Linux or Windows) on the VMC. Virtual machine templates have to be bootstrapped with the Cloud Application Manager Agent.
* If the VMC is behind a firewall, the following ports have to be open on the firewall:
  * **443/TCP incoming to VMC server**: for Cloud Application Manager to make API calls on VMC.
  * **443/TCP outgoing**: to allow Cloud Application Manager Agents running on the deployed virtual machines to connect back to Cloud Application Manager.

### Required Permissions

A VMC user needs at least the following permissions be able to authenticate, deploy and manage instances through Cloud Application Manager.

### Bootstrapping virtual machine templates with the Cloud Application Manager Agent

VMC templates need elasticbox-init to allow the Cloud Application Manager agent to execute box scripts at deploy time.

#### Linux

Follow these steps to install elasticbox-init on a Linux template.

1. Log in to the VMC client and open the Linux virtual machine.

2. SSH into the virtual machine.

3. [Install the VMware tools.](https://www.vmware.com/support/ws55/doc/ws_newguest_tools_linux.html)

4. Run this command with root privileges to install elasticbox-init:

   ```
   curl -L https://cam.ctl.io/agent/linux/vsphere/template_customization_script.sh | sudo bash
   ```

   * **Note:** If running Cloud Application Manager as an appliance, replace cam.ctl.io with the appliance hostname or IP address.

#### Windows

Follow these steps to run a script that creates a scheduled task on a Windows Server 2012 template. When you deploy, Cloud Application Manager clones this template and installs the agent using the scheduled task.

1. Log in to the Windows Server 2012 virtual machine template using remote desktop protocol (RDP).

2. [Install the VMware tools](https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1018377).

3. [Download the scheduled task script.](https://cam.ctl.io/agent/windows/vsphere/template_customization_script.ps1)

   * **Note:** If running Cloud Application Manager as an appliance, replace cam.ctl.io with the appliance hostname or IP address.

4. Right-click the script and click **Run PowerShell**.

### Registering a CenturyLink Private Cloud with VMC on AWS provider in Cloud Application Manager

In order to deploy to a VMC on AWS, you must first provide information to connect.

**Steps**

1. In Cloud Application Manager, click **Providers** > **New Provider**.

2. Select **CenturyLink Private Cloud with VMC on AWS**.

3. Enter the endpoint URL for the VMC server and a username, password to the VMC API.
   * **Note:** The endpoint URL can be a hostname or an IP address, and has to be prefixed with **<https://>**. Be sure to use https and not http.

### Registering Instances to Your VMC Provider

You can also register you exsiting instances to CAM portal. First click on **Unregistered Instances** Tab, here you can see all the exsting instances in you VMC that you can import into your CAM portal.

Simply select one server and click on the down arrow button on the right side.

After running the script you should be able to see the instance has been registered successfully.

### Deploying in Your VMC

You can deploy new instances to your VMC provider from CAM portal, for detailed steps, please check [Using the vmware vCenter Private Datacenter.md](using-the-vmware-vcenter-private-datacenter.md)
