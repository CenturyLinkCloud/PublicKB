### Overview

Providers is part of the basics of Cloud Application Manager. This article is meant to assist Cloud Application Manager customers who are starting using the plataform.

### Audience

All Cloud Application Manager customers.

### Prerequisites

### Providers

A provider is a public or private cloud account you register in Cloud Application Manager.

Before you can deploy workloads from Cloud Application Manager, you need to register a provider first.
