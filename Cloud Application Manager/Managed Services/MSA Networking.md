### Connectivity and Required Firewall Rules


Because of the dynamic nature of our endpoints and management appliances, we recommend applying the following stateful rules to subnets hosting MSA management appliances


#### External Connections from MSA Management Appliance

| Description | Purpose          | Protocol | Port | Destination |
|-------------|------------------|----------|------|-------------|
| HTTPS       | CAM Management   | TCP      | 443  | 0.0.0.0/0   |
| RabbitMQ    | Monitoring       | TCP      | 5671 | 0.0.0.0/0   |
| ISAKMP      | Remote Admin     | UDP      | 500  | 0.0.0.0/0   |
| IPSEC       | Remote Admin     | UDP      | 4500 | 0.0.0.0/0   |


#### Internal Connections from MSA Management Appliance

| Description | Purpose      | Protocol | Port | Destination                                           |
|-------------|--------------|----------|------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| SSH         | Remote Admin | TCP      | 22   | Internal Networks Managed by MSA Management Appliance |
| HTTPS       | Monitoring   | TCP      | 443  | Internal Networks Managed by MSA Management Appliance |
| SMB         | Remote Admin | TCP      | 445  | Internal Networks Managed by MSA Management Appliance |
| RDP         | Remote Admin | TCP      | 3389 | Internal Networks Managed by MSA Management Appliance |
