### Introduction
Apache HTTP has been the most popular web server for nearly two decades — and it gets even better with CenturyLink Cloud and our Managed Apache service.

### Overview
Cloud Application Manager’s Managed Services Anywhere (MSA) allows customers to depend on CenturyLink to manage cloud deployed workloads, relieving themselves of the burdens of day to day monitoring, patching and Operational activities.  Through Cloud Application Manager's Managed Service Anywhere (MSA), a customer can provision a VM instance running Apache within any MSA enabled provider and because Managed Services has been enabled on the provider, CenturyLink will manage both the Operating System and Apache.

### Supported Apache HTTP Server
*  HTTP Server version 2.4

### Supported PHP
*  Version 7.0
*  Version 7.1

### License
* Licensing for deployments are provided by the Cloud Provider.  The cost for the RHEL license and the VM it is deployed upon will be reflected within the customer's cloud provider bill, or under the cloud provider's section in the CenturyLink consolidated bill (for customers that have elected to utilize CenturyLink's consolidated billing feature).
