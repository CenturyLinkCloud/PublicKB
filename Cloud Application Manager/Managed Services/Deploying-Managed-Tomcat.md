### Introduction
Apache Tomcat is an open source software implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies. As a collaboration of best-of-breed developers from around the world, Tomcat has rapidly become one of the leading Web servers.

### Overview
Cloud Application Manager’s Managed Services Anywhere (MSA) allows customers to depend on CenturyLink to manage cloud deployed workloads, relieving themselves of the burdens of day to day monitoring, patching and Operational activities.  Through Cloud Application Manager's Managed Service Anywhere (MSA), a customer can provision a VM instance running Apache within any MSA enabled provider and because Managed Services has been enabled on the provider, CenturyLink will manage both the Operating System and Tomcat.
