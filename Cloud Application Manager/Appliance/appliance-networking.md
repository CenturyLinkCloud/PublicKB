### Configuring the Appliance Network Settings
Once up and running, configure how the appliance connects to the network. By default, it tries to get a dynamic IP address via DHCP. But we recommend that you set a static IP address with these steps so that Cloud Application Manager services are always available at the same address to users.

**Steps**
1. Locate the VM console where you installed the appliance in vCenter or OpenStack.

2. In the Advanced Menu, select **Networking > Static IP**.

3. Enter settings based on your network configuration to set up a static IP address for the appliance. When done, click **Apply**.

   * **IP Address** - Unique IPv4 address the appliance needs to connect to the network.
   * **Netmask** - Subnet mask or address of nearest local area network, for example, 255.255.255.0.
   * **Default Gateway** - Enter the subnet router’s IP address. This is similar to the IP address except for the last digit.
   * **Name Server** -  Enter the preferred and alternate DNS server addresses in each name server field.

4. Reboot the appliance to apply the configuration changes. In the appliance console, click **Advanced Menu > Reboot**.
