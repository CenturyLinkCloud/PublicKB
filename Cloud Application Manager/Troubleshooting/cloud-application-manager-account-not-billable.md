### Introduction

CenturyLink Cloud does not currently sell Azure through [Cloud Application Manager](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager) to the following types of accounts:
* Resellers
* Internal accounts
* Demo accounts
* Sub-accounts of those categories listed above

### Non-Billable Accounts

The following error will appear if the CenturyLink Cloud account alias you provide is a reseller, internal, demo or sub-account, and is therefore designated "not billable."

Here's how you might arrive at this error message. After you log into Cloud Application Manager, click the **Provider** tab on the top toolbar.

![Cloud Application Manager Create New Provider](../../images/cloud-application-manager-error3.png)

Then click **New Provider** on the left navigation bar.

Select **Microsoft Azure** to build a customer account in the current Microsoft Azure. Note: this is the new Azure, not the classic Azure. The dialog box that appears will enable you to create a new Azure customer account. Add a name for the account and select the **Create a new Azure Subscription** option.
