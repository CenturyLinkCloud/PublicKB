### Overview
Policies are a collection of checks that can be configured and applied to one or more agents.  This tab will show a list of all policies that the customer has set up.  Each policy will show the name, the description the customer gave, as well as how many checks are configured for the policy.

From there you will be able to set up the metric or status checks you want to see.  You can also set up the servers (**Agents**) you want to associate the checks with as well.
