### Billing Dashboard

When you click on **Billing** in the left side menu you will land into a dashboard page, where a bar graph with the billed amount for the previous months will be shown. You can change the range of months being shown in the bars graph by selecting a different value in the date filter and you can also select the consumption categories you want to display with the consumption category type filter.

The bar graph shows the billed amount at the chosen scope. If the scope is cost center, the graph only shows the billed amount associated with this scope. If you are in the organization scope, the graph shows the billed amount for the whole organization.
