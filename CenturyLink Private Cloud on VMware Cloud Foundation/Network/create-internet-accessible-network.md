### Description
In this KB article, we walk through how to create a new software-defined network in CenturyLink Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation (CPC on vCF). In this particular use case, we would like to allow this network to have Outbound Internet., and will do the following:

1. Create the Network
2. Create a Firewall Rule to allow Outbound Internet Access for the Network
3. Create a Source NAT Rule to allow Outbound Internet Access for the Network

### Steps

#### Create the Network

Log in to your CPC on vCF environment.

Click __Datacenters__ from the menu dropdown. Select your Datacenter. Select __Networks__ in the left side-panel. On the Networks page, click __NEW__

##### Create the Firewall Rule to allow Outbound Internet Access for the Network

* In vCloud Director, under Networking, click Edges, select your Edge (siteID-edge-0) and click CONFIGURE SERVICES

  ![Network](../../images/dccf/network8.png)

* In the Edge Gateway - siteID-edge-0 page, ensure Firewall is selected, then click + to add a New Rule

  ![Network](../../images/dccf/network9.png)

* Enter the following for the New Rule:

  * Name: Outbound 10.20.30.0 network
  * Type: User (by default)
  * Source: Click IP, enter 10.20.30.0/24 and click KEEP

    ![Network](../../images/dccf/network10.png)

  * Destination: Any (by default) - varies by requirements
  * Service: Any (by default) - varies by requirements
  * Action: Accept
  * Enable logging: Unchecked (by default) - varies by requirements
  * Click Save changes

##### Create a Source NAT Rule to allow Outbound Internet Access for the Network

* In the Edge Gateway - siteID-edge-0 page, click NAT, then click + SNAT RULE (under NAT 44 Rules)

  __Note:__ You will need to make a note of the Public IP that is listed under Translated in order to create this SNAT rule.

  ![Network](../../images/dccf/network12.png)

* Enter the following for the New Rule:

  * Applied On: Public-1
  * Original Source IP/Range: 10.20.30.0/24
  * Translated Source IP/Range: This is the Public IP you recorded from the note above
  * Click KEEP
