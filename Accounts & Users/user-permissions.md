Control Portal permissions are controlled by adding users to one or more roles. Roles are simply a collection of actions that a user is allowed to perform for areas within the Control Portal. You can configure roles for a user by going to Control Portal &gt; Account &gt; Permissions and following the steps below.

The permissions settings page includes a list of roles and their respective descriptions (shown below). For a complete matrix of roles and the specific functions they can perform, reference the [Role Permissions Matrix](../Accounts & Users/role-permissions-matrix.md) for details.
