Users can be configured for both the Control Portal and the API.

### Control Portal Users

You can manage users on your account by going to the Control Portal > Settings > Users.

**Important Notes:** 
* Permissions must be configured for a user after they are created in order to have access within the control. Learn more about [User Permissions](user-permissions.md).

* A Control account username must be globally unique in the platform and cannot be reused, or otherwise reissued/migrated into a different Control account. If the user account is deleted, it cannot be reinstated or repurposed for another user. This constraint is currently an intentional design specification built into the CenturyLink Cloud Control platform.

**Creating Users**
1. Click the "Create New User" button.

2. Fill in all required fields. The entered email address must be unique as it will also be the username.
