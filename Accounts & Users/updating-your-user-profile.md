#### SAML Profile

Customers who have integrated CenturyLink Cloud with an authentication solution that uses Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) may also update their SAML username through the User Profile. Find out more about using SAML for [single sign-on](../Control Portal/using-saml-for-single-sign-on-to-the-centurylink-platform-control-portal.md) or [multi-factor authentication](../Control Portal/using-saml-for-multi-factor-authentication-to-centurylink-control-portal.md).  

### Important Notes

#### Updating a Password

A password can be changed any time. Go to the User Profile window and select the Password field. Input a password that is at least eight characters in length and contains at least one number and one special character.

#### Updating a PIN

A user is assigned a PIN at the time the user profile is created. You can customize your PIN at any time by navigating to the User Profile window and selecting the PIN field. A PIN can be between 4 and 10 numeric characters.  

#### Deleting a User Profile

A User Profile may be deleted by an account administrator, but this will cause issues if you want to reuse the same username. A custom request needs to be filed by emailing help@ctl.io. CenturyLink Cloud management approval is required.
