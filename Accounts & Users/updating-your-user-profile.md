Editing your user profile is a straightforward process. Click the Profile icon in the upper right hand corner of the Control Portal and select "Profile" in the dropdown menu.

Once you are in the User Profile window, select the field you wish to change. When selected, the field will turn light blue, and the field's data becomes editable. Update the data, and then click the green "Save" button once you are satisfied with the changes you've made.

User name, password, PIN, email address, and first and last name are required fields. Additional information, such as title and phone number(s), can be provided optionally. Customers who have integrated CenturyLink Cloud with an authentication solution that uses Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) may also update their SAML username through the User Profile. Find out more about using SAML for [single sign-on](../Control Portal/using-saml-for-single-sign-on-to-the-centurylink-platform-control-portal.md) or [multi-factor authentication](../Control Portal/using-saml-for-multi-factor-authentication-to-centurylink-control-portal.md).  

## Important Notes

#### Updating a Password

A password can be changed any time. Go to the User Profile window and select the Password field. Input a password that is at least eight characters in length and contains at least one number and one special character.


#### Updating a PIN

A user is assigned a PIN at the time the user profile is created. You can customize your PIN at any time by navigating to the User Profile window and selecting the PIN field. A PIN can be between 4 and 10 numeric characters.  

#### Fields That Cannot be Changed

The following fields cannot be edited:

* User Name

#### Deleting a User Profile

A User Profile may be deleted by an account administrator, but this will cause issues if you want to reuse the same username. A custom request needs to be filed by emailing noc@ctl.io. CenturyLink Cloud management approval is required.
