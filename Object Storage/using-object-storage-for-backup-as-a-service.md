### Overview
CenturyLink Cloud customers may wish to leverage our S3 compatible Object Storage for backup and recovery of file systems or applications. As Object Storage is consumable by any customer in a public fashion, applications or servers can be located within the CenturyLink Cloud or on premise. There are various industry backup tools that support object storage as a repository for data. In this Knowledge Base article we will focus on [Cloudberry Lab](http://www.cloudberrylab.com).

[Cloudberry Ultimate Edition](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/enterprise-cloud-backup-software.aspx) permits backup of Microsoft Windows Server File Systems (backup files, folders, **network shares** and **system image**), Microsoft SQL and Microsoft Exchange data.

[Cloudberry Backup for Mac](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/backupmac.aspx) permits backup of Mac OS X File Systems (backup files and folders).

[Cloudberry Backup for Linux](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/backuplinux.aspx) permits backup of Linux File Systems (backup files and folders).

[Cloudberry Backup for QNAP NAS](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/backup-qnap.aspx) offers QNAP NAS data backup directly to CentryLink Object storage.

[Cloudberry Backup for Synology NAS](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/backup-synology.aspx) offers Synology NAS data backup directly to CentryLink Object storage.

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate edition - add new account](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberry-ultimate-add-storage.jpg)

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - select CenturyLink](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberrylab-select-cloud-storage-centurylink-focused.jpg)

2. Populate the S3 Compatible Account information with your CenturyLink Cloud [Object Storage Access Key, Secret Key, Service Point and bucket name.](../Object Storage/using-object-storage-from-the-control-portal.md) [All service points are listed here.](//www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/object-storage/object-storage-regions-and-service-points/)

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - set up CenturyLink account](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberrylab-centurylink-storage-account-configuration.jpg)

3. Optionally, you may input cost estimate parameters as part of the storage account setup. By using this component the Cloudberry Lab backup software is able to estimate your costs for storage. **This is an estimate on storage (excluding bandwidth charges) and does not necessarily reflect actual CenturyLink Cloud Object Storage fees.**

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - storage cost estimates](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberrylab-enable-cost-estimates.jpg)     

4. Your CenturyLink object storage account should now be created successfully.

#### <a name="file-level-backup"></a>Configuring file level backup for Windows

1. Make sure you are in «Home», select «Files».

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - file level backup](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberry-ultimate-file-level-backup.jpg)

2. Select the CenturyLink Object Storage account you created recently (as described above).

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - select CenturyLink object storage](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberry-ultimate-select-storage-account.jpg)

3. Specify a name for the backup plan. We recommend a name that encompasses the server name, backup type (file, SQL etc.) as a minimum. Additionally, it is advised that backup plan configurations are saved to the backup storage (Default).

  ![Cloudberrylab Ultimate - backup plan name](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberrylab-ultimate-backup-plan-name.jpg)

4. Choose an appropriate backup mode based on the features you require. Typical enterprise customers will want to leverage the Advanced Mode approach as it provides for Data Encryption and complex retention policies.

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - backup mode](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberrylab-ultimate-backup-mode.jpg)

5. It is recommended to have «Force using VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service)» for file level backup in order to access files that potentially could be busy by the third-party application when the backup is in progress. Others - optionally, based on backup / restore requirements.

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - advcaned options (force VSS etc)](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberrylab-ultimate-advanced-options.jpg)

6. Select the backup source. Entire Windows volumes, specific directories, UNC Shares (**network shares**) or user profiles can be added to the backup plan.

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - backup source](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberry-ultimate-backup-source.jpg)

7. The Advanced Filter allows administrators to include or exclude specific file types, folders and large files. Select the appropriate settings based on IT Department or business policies.

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - Advanced filter](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberry-ultimate-advanced-filter.jpg)

8. In order to secure backup data and reduce cost customers can enable encryption and compression. It is recommended that AES 128bit or higher is implement with long, complex encryption keys. Additionally, file name encryption adds another layer of security.

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - compression and encryption otions](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberry-ultimate-compression-encryption-options.jpg)

9. Specify the appropriate retention policy for backup files. Defaults can be viewed by selecting the 'options' hyperlink. Clients may wish to keep file system backups based on number of versions or based on data set age.

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - retention policy](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberry-ultimate-retention-policy.jpg)

10. Choose a backup schedule that meets IT or business requirements. Generally, its best practice to perform a backup at least once per day during off hours. The Cloudberry Backup software supports recurring scheduled backups and even real-time backup of data.

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - schedule options](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberry-ultimate-schedule-options.jpg)

11. In this example we selected recurring, and set the schedule for Daily at 8 PM.

  ![Cloudberry Ultimate - recurring options](../images/cloudberrylab/cloudberry-ultimate-recurring-options.jpg)
