S3CMD is a Linux command line utility that can be used to interact with and manage your CenturyLink Cloud [Object Storage](https://www.ctl.io/object-storage/) buckets and data, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and associated metadata. S3CMD is an advanced tool to be used for accessing object storage, so care should be taken. This article covers the following topics:
* Installing S3CMD
* Configuring S3CMD for CenturyLink Object Storage
* Using S3CMD
* Special Note About S3CMD Versions
* Ways to Improve Transfer Speed

## Installing S3CMD
Before you can use S3CMD, make sure that it is installed. At the command line, enter `which s3cmd`. If the command gives no output, then you do not have S3CMD installed and need to add it.

The simplest way to add it is to use the package manager for your version of Linux, probably either `yum` or `apt`. While S3CMD is included in many package managers, it is best to manually configure the official repository to ensure that you are using the latest version.

### Adding the Repository to a CentOS or RHEL Machine
Note: Both instructions assume you are running as root. Your will need to add “sudo” where appropriate if not logged in as root).
1. Install wget, if not already installed by entering the command: `yum install wget –y`.

2. Enter the command: c`d /etc/yum.repos.d`.

3. Download the appropriate file for your distribution:
   * For CentOS/RHEL 5 enter the command `wget http://s3tools.org/repo/RHEL_5/s3tools.repo`.
   * For CentOS/RHEL 6 enter the command `wget http://s3tools.org/repo/RHEL_6/s3tools.repo`.

4. Enter the command: `yum install s3cmd -y`.

### Adding the Repository to a Ubuntu/Debian Machine
1. Install wget, if not already installed by entering the command:  `apt-get install wget –y`.

2. Import the signing key by entering the command: `wget -O - -q http://s3tools.org/repo/deb-all/stable/s3tools.key | apt-key add -`.

3. Add the repository by entering the command: `wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/s3tools.list http://s3tools.org/repo/deb-all/stable/s3tools.list`.

4. Refresh your packages and install by entering the command: `apt-get update && apt-get install s3cmd`.

## Configuring S3CMD
Once S3CMD has been installed, it must be configured to use CenturyLink Cloud’s Object Storage.
1. S3CMD stores its settings in a configuration file. You can either run `s3cmd –configure` to launch an interactive configuration generation tool, or specify a pre-existing file.

2. You need both your **access Key ID** and your **secret access key**. You can find them by clicking **Services > Object Storage**.

3. On the Object Storage page, click the **Users** tab and then the appropriate username.
   ![Access Keys](../images/kb-object-storage-access-keys.png)

4. Enter your encryption password.

5. Press enter as the default path to gpg should be correct.

6. Select **Yes** for HTTPS, unless explicitly directed otherwise.

7. You are then asked to test your settings. Select **NO** as it will fail.

8. Select **Yes** when prompted to save your configuration file. The .s3cfg file will be created in your users home directory.

9. Open it with a text editor. In this example we use `vi`. Enter the command: `vi ~/.s3cfg`.

10. In the configuration file, change the following fields with the appropriate CenturyLink Cloud data center.
   ```
   host_base = canada.os.ctl.io
   host_bucket = %(bucket)s.canada.os.ctl.io
   ```

   Alternatively, you can modify and save the following file and then specify s3cmd to use it by entering the command: `s3cmd –c /path/to/config file`.

### Sample configuration file
**Note**: The following configuration line items must be edited.
* access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
* gpg_passphrase = password
* host_base = canada.os.ctl.io
* host_bucket = %(bucket)s.canada.os.ctl.io
* secret_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
* use_https = False

```
access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
bucket_location = US
cloudfront_host = cloudfront.amazonaws.com
cloudfront_resource = /2010-07-15/distribution
default_mime_type = binary/octet-stream
delete_removed = False
dry_run = False
enable_multipart = False
encoding = UTF-8
encrypt = False
follow_symlinks = False
force = False
get_continue = False
gpg_command = /usr/local/bin/gpg
gpg_decrypt = %(gpg_command)s -d --verbose --no-use-agent --batch --yes --passphrase-fd %(passphrase_fd)s -o %(output_file)s %(input_file)s
gpg_encrypt = %(gpg_command)s -c --verbose --no-use-agent --batch --yes --passphrase-fd %(passphrase_fd)s -o %(output_file)s %(input_file)s
gpg_passphrase = password
guess_mime_type = True
host_base = canada.os.ctl.io
host_bucket = %(bucket)s.canada.os.ctl.io
human_readable_sizes = False
list_md5 = False
log_target_prefix =
preserve_attrs = True
progress_meter = True
proxy_host =
proxy_port = 0
recursive = False
recv_chunk = 4096
reduced_redundancy = False
secret_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
send_chunk = 4096
simpledb_host = sdb.amazonaws.com
skip_existing = False
socket_timeout = 300
urlencoding_mode = normal
use_https = False
verbosity = WARNING
```

### Creating the Object Storage Bucket
To begin using S3CMD, you need to create an Object Storage user and a bucket, which you can create through the CenturyLink Cloud [Control Portal](https://control.ctl.io/).

1. From the Navigation Menu, click  **Services > Object Storage**.

2. Click the **User** tab and then **create user**.

3. Fill out the required fields.
   ![Create User](../images/kb-object-storage-create-user.png)

4. Click **save**.

5. Click the **Buckets** tab and then **create bucket**.

6. Enter the **bucket name**. Select the **owner** from the drop-down menu. Then, select a **region**.
   * You can add additional users or modify the permissions after creating the bucket. Simply click the bucket name.
   ![Create Bucket](../images/kb-object-storage-create-bucket.png)

7. Click **save**.

## Using S3CMD
Now that S3cmd has been configured, you can issue normal commands and interact with your storage. Run `S3cmd –-man` for a full list of commands.
1. Make a bucket with `s3cmd mb s3://my-new-bucket-name`.

2. List the contents of a bucket with `s3cmd ls s3://my-new-bucket-name`.

3. Upload a file with `s3cmd put testfile.xml s3://my-new-bucket-name/testfile.xml`.

4. Download/Retrieve a file `s3cmd get s3://my-new-bucket-name/testfile.xml testfile_modified.xml`.

## Special Note About S3CMD Versions
S3CMD is an active open-source project, and as such is frequently updated. Depending on the version of S3CMD you installed, the default authentication strategy may have changed. Using the incorrect authentication strategy will result in **403 Not Authorized** or **S3 error: Access Denied** errors for some requests to object storage. You can tell which version of S3CMD you have by running the `s3cmd --version` command and inspecting the output. If the version is before **1.5.0** then s3cmd will operate correctly.

If your version is **1.5.0** or newer, then there are two ways to make this work correctly again.
* The first is to provide the **--signature-v2** argument to S3CMD, for example `s3cmd --signature-v2 ls`. The argument tells S3CMD to revert to the original authentication strategy.
* The more permanent change is to add `signature_v2 = True` to the bottom of the .s3cfg file. That forces S3CMD to use the original authentication strategy every time the command is run.

## Ways to Improve Transfer Speed
When uploading or downloading a large file, consider to put s3cmd in quiet mode (`no-progress` option) to minimize the output to console (stdout), as stdout could potentially slow down the transfer process.

Look for the second article in this series which will discuss using advanced S3cmd features such as rsync and encryption!
