### Documentation

<p>We currently do not have an official free plan anymore. However, if you had previously had aÂ free level account with us during the maintenance in February 2014, our <a href="mailto:billing@appfog.com">billing team</a> can downgrade you back to this. Please keep in mind that your resources will be drastically reduced from what they are with the paid plan.</p>
<p>If you upgraded before the maintenance in February 2014, we cannot downgrade you to a free plan.</p>
