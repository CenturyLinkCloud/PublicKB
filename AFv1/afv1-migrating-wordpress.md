### WordPress Migration
CenturyLink has launched [WordPress as a Service](https://www.ctl.io/wordpress/) on CenturyLink Cloud. More information can be found on the [WordPress](../WordPress/) Knowledge Base page. There is a [WordPress Site Migration to CenturyLink Cloud](../WordPress/wordpress-site-migration-to-centurylink-cloud.md) guide. Please review our other migration guides including [Migrating an App](how-to-migrate-an-application.md) and [Migrating a Service](export-services-and-third-party-alternatives.md).
