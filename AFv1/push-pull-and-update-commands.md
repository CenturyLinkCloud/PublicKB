### IMPORTANT

This document is for users of AppFog v1. This document does not apply to the current AppFog service that is located in CenturyLink Cloud Control Portal.

### Documentation

<p>This lines out some details to how the <code>push</code>, <code>pull</code>, and <code>update</code> commands should work.</p>
<h4>PUSH</h4>
<h4><code>af push {app}</code></h4>
<p>The command <code>push</code> ZIPs the content in the current directory and uploads it to the environment. For more information on the structure of a app, visit our [Application Configuration](application-configuration-using-manifest-files-and-afignore.md) article. If you have a ZIP file located within this directory, it can cause the problems lined out in the [Application Configuration](ZIP files) section of that article. An example for an application called <code>user-php</code> is below.</p>
<pre>user@localhost: ~/af/apps/my_test_php_app$ af push user-php

<h4>PULL</h4>
<h4><code>af pull {app}</code></h4>
<p>The command <code>pull</code> bundles content currently running on the platform and downloads it as a ZIP file. It is then automatically extracted to a file named after the app under the local directory. An example for an application called <code>user-php</code> is below.</p>
<pre>user@localhost:~/af/apps$ af pull user-php
Pulling last pushed source code: OK

user@localhost:~/af/apps$ ls
user-php  my_test_php_app
user@localhost:~/af/apps$ cd user-php/
user@localhost:~/af/apps/user-php$ ls
index.php</pre>
<h4>UPDATE</h4>
<h4><code>af update {app}</code></h4>
<p>The command <code>update</code> updates the specified application with the <strong>all</strong> content in your current directory. If you have a ZIP file located within this directory, it can cause the problems lined out in the <a href="./application-configuration-using-manifest-files-and-afignore.md">ZIP Files</a> section of our Application Configuration article above. An example for an application called <code>user-php</code> is below.</p>
<pre>user@localhost:~/af/apps$ ls
user-php  my_test_php_app
user@localhost:~/af/apps$ cd user-php/
user@localhost:~/af/apps/derek-php$ af update user-php
