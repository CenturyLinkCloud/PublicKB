### IMPORTANT

This document is for users of AppFog v1 for migration to the next generation of AppFog that is located in CenturyLink Cloud Control Portal.

Before deleting any applications or services on AppFog v1 ensure you have local copies. Once apps and services are deleted it is **permanent**. We will not be able to provide a backup.

### Working as a Team
AppFog v2 provides a feature similar to AppFog v1 Teams. AppFog v2 offers the option for the AppFog Admin role holder to create users for the account and set permissions. Here is the Knowledge Base article on how to [Manage AppFog Membership](../AppFog/manage-appfog-membership.md).
