### IMPORTANT

This document is for users of AppFog v1 for migration to the next generation of AppFog that is located in CenturyLink Cloud Control Portal.

Before deleting any applications or services on AppFog v1 ensure you have local copies. Once apps and services are deleted it is **permanent**. We will not be able to provide a backup.

When migration is complete your billing subscription can be canceled from the [Account](https://console.appfog.com/#account) page of the web console. Please be sure to cancel your subscription as we are not aware when individual user migration is complete. The billing system will not automatically prorate the subscription and issue a refund. If applicable, please open a [Support Ticket](https://support.appfog.com/tickets/new) or email support@appfog.com to receive a prorated refund of your subscription.


### Working as a Team
AppFog v2 provides a feature similar to AppFog v1 Teams. AppFog v2 offers the option for the AppFog Admin role holder to create users for the account and set permissions. Here is the Knowledge Base article on how to [Manage AppFog Membership](../AppFog/manage-appfog-membership.md).
