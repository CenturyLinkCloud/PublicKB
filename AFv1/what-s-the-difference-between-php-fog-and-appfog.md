### Documentation

<p><a href="https://phpfog.com">PHP Fog</a>, our original product, was a Platform-as-a-Service built specifically for PHP-based web apps. It ran on Amazon's AWS US-East data center and supported github integration, private VMs, and SSL.</p>
<p>PHP Fog was replaced by AppFog, which launched in the Summer of 2012, and PHP Fog was finally sunsetted in March of 2013.</p>
