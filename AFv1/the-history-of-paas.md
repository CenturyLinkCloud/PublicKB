<h1>The History of PaaS</h1>
<p>By: Andrei Matei</p>
<p><strong>The History of PaaS<br /> </strong>While Cloud Computing is now a well-entrenched term in the IT space, several of its components, specifically PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, have gained a significant amount of traction in just the last few years.<br /> <strong><br /> The Early Years<br /> </strong>Interestingly enough, one of the earliest forms of PaaS emerged all the way back in 2005, even before the launch of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>'s now cornerstone Infrastructure as a Service Offering, EC2, <a href="http://university.appfog.com/images/mosso.png">Mosso</a>, a product way ahead of its time, began as a side-project in one of the back corners of the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com">Rackspace</a> offices by two developers who understood that customers wanted scalability and one-click deployments without the limitations of shared hosting. More on the history of Mosso and the Rackspace Cloud here: <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/aboutus/story">http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/aboutus/story</a>.</p>
<p>Mosso offered customers a distributed, redundant, scalable PHP and .Net platform for applications with no administration or server management knowledge needed.  Mosso touted itself as "Cloud Computing for the rest of us" and it made getting sites online extremely easy, even for those who were not technically inclined. Its popularity, and a few of its stumbles along the way, certainly opened up the PaaS market to a whole slew of new eyes.</p>
<p><strong>PaaS Gains Momentum</strong><br /> Fast forward to 2008 and companies such as <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> and <a href="http://www.engineyard.com">EngineYard</a> arrived on the scene to compete. These two services, specializing in Ruby on Rails deployments at their onset, targeted a completely separate market: the technically savvy Ruby developer. While the systems were more complex to use, and customers had to be familiar with Git and APIs, they offered a slew of powerful application deployment and management features. More on Heroku's history here: <a href="http://www.flourish.org/blog/?p=687">http://www.flourish.org/blog/?p=687</a></p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/">Mircosoft Azure</a> became commercially available as the first .Net/Windows-centric PaaS solution. While initially offering a bit of a steep learning curve for users, it gained a significant amount of attention in the industry.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a href="https://www.dotcloud.com">dotCloud</a>, RedHat's <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/">OpenShift</a>, <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org">Cloud Foundry</a>, and <a href="http://www.phpfog.com">PHP Fog</a> were unleashed on the general public. dotCloud and OpenShift were multi-language offerings. PHP Fog, while PHP-only, focused on an extremely elegant and responsive user workflow in front of a high-performance solution which just worked.</p>
<p><strong>Open is Key</strong><br /> Also in 2011, Cloud Foundry, an open-source Cloud Computing Platform-as-a-Service, developed by <a href="http://vmware.com">VMWare</a>, made as many ripples in the PaaS landscape as Mosso did in its early days. Cloud Foundry, both as a deployable system, and a hosted service, allowed anyone to build a PaaS, in-house, in their colo, or anywhere they wished. This was another game-changer. CloudFoundry, while extremely powerful, was (and still to a great extent is) a very difficult proposition for organizations to deploy and maintain. The skillset needed to successfully run and maintain large-scale CF implementations is still difficult to find in present day.</p>
<p>In 2012, <a href="http://www.appfog.com">AppFog</a>, a company which started PHP Fog back in 2010, announces general availability of its multi-language PaaS, running on top of Cloud Foundry. AppFog takes the administrative headaches of CF away from customers while providing the first open-source, portable PaaS solution with no vendor lock-in for customers. Additionally, AppFog's interoperability with <a href="http://www.openstack.org">Openstack</a> is a boon for developers looking for a portable and open environment for their applications.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprises show interest in PaaS</strong><br /> 2012 marks a pivotal year for Enterprise interest in PaaS. Offerings such as Active State's <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato">Staccato</a>, AppFog, <a href="http://uhurusoftware.com">Uhuru</a> and others are focusing on delivering the security, isolation, and performance demands the largest of enterprise customers seek in a simple-to-use and deploy system for developers.</p>
<p>The future is extremely bright and exciting for PaaS. As new industry developments unfold, we'll continue to add to our History of PaaS article.</p>
