### Overview
The Platform CenturyLink IPS utilizes an Agent installed on your Virtual Machine (VM) that monitors the VM for suspicious activity. If suspicious activity is found, the Agent logs the activity, which it may block or stop, and reports the incident based on the IPS policy. There is a default policy associated with each VM that is automatically tuned based on the host operating system and installed applications.

This Blueprint is for the actual installation and activation of the IPS service on the VM. Other Blueprints will be available for modifications to the installation.

### Prerequisites
