VNS3 lets you manage your cloud deployment with your data center resources as if running locally. A VNS3 network can be distributed across multiple public and private clouds to create one logical group of federated resource. VNS3 doesn't require new knowledge or training to implement, so you can integrate with existing network equipment.

Technology from CohesiveFT helps CenturyLink Cloud customers address the business challenge of secure connectivity by implementing numerous core network/security solutions in to one appliance.  

Easily connect to your existing datacenter edges using industry standard IPsec and SSL VPN - now available as part of the CenturyLink Cloud Blueprint Engine.

### Solution Overview
VNS3 is a networking and security virtual appliance that lets you extend networks into public, private and hybrid clouds. The core network functions of switch, router, firewall, VPN gateway for SSL and IPsec VPNs and protocol redistributor can all be configured through an API or the web based user interface. 

The CohesiveFT VNS3 solution also provides a Docker subsystem that can run container based network application services such as proxy, reverse proxy, SSL/TLS termination, load balancing, content cache, network intrusion detection (NIDS) and web application firewall (WAF).

### Audience
CenturyLink Cloud Users

### Impact
After reading this article, the user should feel comfortable deploying the Cohesive Networks VNS3 virtual appliance technology on CenturyLink Cloud. 

After executing the steps in this Getting Started document, the users will have a functioning VNS3 network/security appliance upon which they can start developing secure connectivity solutions.

### Prerequisite
- Access to the CenturyLink Cloud platform as an authorized user.
- Create a Network VLAN you want the Cohesive Networks VNS3 virtual appliance to reside on.  Creating a new VLAN follows best practices so users can secure the private VIPs with firewalls. Important:  Once you create a new VLAN, or if you use an existing VLAN, through the Control Portal navigate to Networks and then click on the specific VLAN you want to use.  Note down a free IP address, the network mask and the gateway address from the VLAN as these will be used when deploying the VNS3 manager appliance. 
- Configure a Client VPN so that you can securely connect to the VNS3 virtual appliance for configuration.  When accessing your CohesiveFT VNS3 virtual appliance for the first time, we recommend you connect to your CenturyLink Cloud environment via secure Client VPN.    For more information on configuring your Client VPN, please see the "how to configure client vpn" knowledge base article.
- Ensure you have the proper firewall rule settings to allow VPN communication to the VLAN the VNS3 virtual appliance resides on.  For more information, see the "Creating cross data center firewall policies" knowledge base article.

### Postrequisite
- If you want to access your Cohesive Networks VNS3 virtual appliance from the internet, please perform the following tasks once your VNS3 virtual appliance has been deployed to your account and has been configured:

1. Adding an Public IP address to an existing or new CenturyLink server
![Add Public IP](https://t3n.zendesk.com/attachments/token/kObGC9P2IjP1ate0NexwFNiXz/?name=ip.jpg)

2. If required, allow incoming traffic for the admin port.  Warning: Please make sure your VNS3 appliance firewall rules are properly configured to only allow specific source traffic.  If you do not configure source traffic rules you risk exposing your VNS3 appliance admin port to the entire internet.  Note: When accessing your CohesiveFT VNS3 virtual appliance for the first time or for any administration, we recommend you connect to your CenturyLink Cloud environment via Client VPN.
