CenturyLink [Ecosystem Program Partner Members](centurylink-cloud-ecosystem-program-guide.md) gain access to a bevy of [resources](ecosystem-program-resources.md) that make integrations easy.

Creating Server Templates on CenturyLink Cloud enables customers to deploy bit-for-bit replicas of your software as a virtual appliance.

We have two deployment models available:

* **Instant Deploy**.  This looks and feels like a [Blueprint](ecosystem-program-resources-blueprints.md) permitting instant deploys for compatible appliances
* **Universal Deploy**.  Supports nearly any virtual appliance type including those that require console configuration on first boot.  These deploys are performed by CenturyLink operations staff as a Service Task and take longer to deploy.


### (Instant Deploy) Core Documentation

Instant deploy through the CenturyLink bpimager tool is the ideal deployment mechanism for compatible appliances.  Work with an Ecosystem engineer to gain access to this Beta offering.
