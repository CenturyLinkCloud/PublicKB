CenturyLink [Ecosystem Program Partner Members](centurylink-cloud-ecosystem-program-guide.md) gain access to a bevy of [resources](ecosystem-program-resources.md) that make integrations easy.

Creating Server Templates on CenturyLink Cloud enables customers to deploy bit-for-bit replicas of your software as a virtual appliance.

We have two deployment models available:

* **Universal Deploy**.  Supports nearly any virtual appliance type including those that require console configuration on first boot.  These deploys are performed by CenturyLink operations staff as a Service Task and take longer to deploy.

### (Universal Deploy) Core Documentation
