  ![Orchestrate.io](../../images/orchestrate-1.png)

  Click either of the items at right to access that Blueprint directly.

  Alternately, starting from the CenturyLink Control Panel, navigate to the Blueprints Library. Search for “Orchestrate” in the keyword search on the right side of the page.

2. **Click the Deploy Blueprint button.**

3. **Set Required parameters.**

4. **Set optional parameters**

  ![](../../images/orchestrate-3.png)

  Password/Confirm Password (This is the root password for the server. Keep this in a secure place).

  Set DNS to “Manually Specify” and use “8.8.8.8” (or any other public DNS server of your choice).

  Optionally set the server name prefix.

  The default values are fine for every other option.
5. **Review and Confirm the Blueprint**

  Verify your configuration details.

6. **Deploy the Blueprint**

  Once verified, click on the ‘deploy blueprint’ button. You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution. This will kick off the blueprint deploy process and load a page to allow you to track the progress of the deployment. Generally, it will take 15 to 20 minutes to configure all of the components.

7. **Orchestrate Account Provisioned**

  ![](../../images/orchestrate-4.png)

  During the Blueprint execution your email address will be used to create a new Orchestrate account.  Open this and click to verify your email address.

  If there was an error provisioning your Orchestrate account you will receive an alternate email with details on the issue.  The most common problem is using an email address already associated with an Orchestrate account.  To mitigate this please use an alternate address for this demonstration.

8. **Demonstration Provisioning Completed**

  Note this may take several hours as all data is pulled from a variety of Internet sources

9. **Explore the Marvel Universe with Orchestrate and CenturyLink Cloud**
