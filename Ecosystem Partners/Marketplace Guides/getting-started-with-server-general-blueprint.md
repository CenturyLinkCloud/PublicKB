### Description
Server General has integrated their technology with the CenturyLink Cloud platform. The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage of this integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for this data-at-rest encryption solution.

Technology from Server General helps CenturyLink Cloud customers address the business challenge of complying with industry mandates and government regulations like HIPAA/HITECH, FERPA, FISMA, EU Privacy Law and PCI DSS by implementing data-at-rest encryption service solution - now available as part of the CenturyLink Cloud Blueprint Engine.

### Solution Overview
Almost all data security regulations require access to the sensitive information to be tightly controlled. However, it is not so easy to do so these days. Perimeter security concepts are no longer valid because the bad guys can get the firewall. Once inside, they can interrogate various servers at will and find treasure troves of data that can be sold or can be used to blackmail the compromised organization. Sony Corporation is a prime example of just such an act. So now the question is how to protect data from people who are on the inside and perhaps have privileged access to sensitive servers? Data-at-rest encryption can provide a layer of defense. However, encryption alone is not sufficient. It must be closely tied to advanced access control mechanisms. Moreover, the encryption keys must be stored at a secure location and should be available at all times to authorized entities. Lastly the logs have to be stored beyond the reach of all concerned parties to eliminate any possibility of contamination.

Server General and CenturyLink deliver data Encryption as a Service that addresses the above mentioned security concerns and enables customers to achieve regulatory compliance via the use of the following techniques:

1. Transparent data-at-rest encryption using AES
2. Lifetime key management service that includes key generation, key store, key rotation and revocation
3. Protection against the "root" user
4. Remote logging outside of the administrative domain of the interested parties
5. Role-base management

Below is a solution architecture diagram that illustrates how a state of enhanced security is achieved.

It is important to note that both the CenturyLink and Server General staff does not have access to the actual encryption keys. The keys are re-encrypted using Master Keys of their respective data owners. Only the cipher blobs are stored in our global managed key locker infrastructure. Also, our customers have the option of using a dedicated managed key lockers deployed within their own own data center or within CenturyLink network.

#### How do I login as Server General Admin?
* Access your server via ssh as the root user. You created this password during the server installation time. Once you are logged in, you should look for the ssh key for the sgadmin user in /home/sgadmin/.ssh directory. Copy the id_dsa file to your workstation. Change access permissions to 400 for this file (id_dsa). You can then log in to the server as the sgadmin user with help of this ssh key (ssh -i path_to where_you_stored_your_id_dsa_file sgadmin@IP_address_of_your_server
