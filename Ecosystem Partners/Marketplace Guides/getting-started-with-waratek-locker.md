### Partner Profile
Waratek, a pioneer in Runtime Application Self Protection, secures applications from logic, network and vulnerability exploits without code changes, agents or hardware devices, placing security within your own control. This enables applications to be run on a public cloud while retaining a level of protection normally only available in the enterprise data center.

In 2015 the RSA Conference’s Innovation Sandbox awarded Waratek the title of Most Innovative Company saying it was *an inventive solution to a ‘massive problem’.*

### Description
Waratek has made their award winning Cloud Based Application Security solution, Locker, available on the CenturyLink Cloud platform, publishing their virtual appliance as a CenturyLink Cloud Partner Template. This KB article should help the reader understand why Runtime Application Self Protection has been described as the "Must Have Emerging Technology’ and why use of it can help you confidently move more of your applications to a cloud based environment.

Waratek Locker provides a secure container for your Java applications and enables a legacy Java application to be run in an up-to-date container to gain modern security fixes. Due to its unique understanding of application logic, Locker is able to secure your application against the OWASP and SANS leading attack vectors, such as SQL injection, with zero false positives.

### Solution Overview
Waratek Locker is a secure container for Java applications which provides [run-time application self-protection](http://www.waratek.com/runtime-application-self-protection/) ([RASP](http://www.waratek.com/runtime-application-self-protection/)) against [Advanced Persistent Threats](http://www.waratek.com/solutions/threat-forensics/) and [Zero Day attacks](http://www.waratek.com/solutions/zero-day-malware/). This enables applications to be run on a public cloud while retaining a level of protection normally only available in the enterprise data centre.

Locker uses the same technology as Waratek’s flagship [AppSecurity for Java](http://www.waratek.com/products/appsecurity-for-java/) product to provide security monitoring, policy enforcement and attack blocking from within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This enables Locker to protect cloud applications against exploits that target vulnerabilities in third party libraries or legacy Java, as well as malware and Advanced Persistent Threats attempting SQL injection attacks.

Vulnerability exploitations protected against include the following:

* Attacks leveraging unsecured code (including 3rd party libraries)
* Insertion of malicious code into the runtime environment
* Unauthorized attempts to extract information from database backends

Applications are deployed in a secure Locker container and are governed by a single rules file. Each rule added to this file will control an aspect of an applications behavior. When a rule detects an attack, one of a series of mitigating actions will occur. These can range from logging and monitoring, to blocking the event. Locker has a default set of rules which block malicious attacks such as File access, Network access and SQL Injection. It is then easy for the application provider to add and customize additional rules giving fine-grained security control.

### Technology Profile
Waratek Locker is a secure container, which includes an Oracle certified Java virtual machine (JVM) running a standard Apache Tomcat application server. When a Java application is deployed Locker's security technology monitors its runtime environment. When it detects real-time attacks, it is capable of controlling how the application executes and thus secures it from Advanced Persistent Threats (Advanced Persistent Threats). Furthermore, this award-winning and patented technology can detect and prevent malicious attacks without any code changes to an application.

This CenturyLink Blueprint provides a simple install solution of Waratek Locker on CentOS 6 and Apache Tomcat 7. It is also possible to use other application servers such as JBoss or Weblogic. Please contact Waratek to find out more.
