  * **Control User Password** - The password associated with your control.ctl.io login

4. **Set Optional Parameters**

  Password/Confirm Password (This is the root password for the server. Keep this in a secure place).  

  Set DNS to “Manually Specify” and use “8.8.8.8” (or any other public DNS server of your choice).

  Optionally set the server name prefix.

  The default values are fine for every other option.

5. **Review and Confirm the Blueprint**

6. **Deploy the Blueprint**

  Once verified, click on the **deploy blueprint** button. You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution.

7. **Deployment Complete**

  Once the Blueprint has finished execution you will receive a number of emails.  The first will indicate the server has been deployed and the second will come a few minutes later once the appliance has been fully activated.  If you do not receive an email like the one shown below you may have had a deployment error - review the *Blueprint Build Log* to for error messages.

  <div style="float:left;width:45%;margin-left:1em;">
    *Email #1: Appliance deploy started*
    <img src="../../images/bpimager/appliance_deploy_started.png" style="border:0;width:100%;">

    <img src="../../images/bpimager/appliance_deploy_complete.png" style="border:0;width:100%;">
