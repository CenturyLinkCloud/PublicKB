3. Configure the Blueprint.
Complete the information below:

   * Execute on Server: Select a Linux x64 server to deploy the Blueprint on.
   * Apache Web Server Port, e.g., 80
   * SSL Port, e.g., 443
   * Web Server domain, e.g., 127.0.0.1
   * MySQL Server port, e.g., 3306
   * Login, e.g., user
   * Your real name, e.g., User Name
   * Email Address, e.g., user@example.com
   * Password
   * Do you want to configure mail support?, e.g., 0
   * Default email provider:, e.g., custom
   * SMTP User
   * SMTP Password
   * SMTP Port, e.g., 587
   * SMTP Host
   * Secure connection, e.g., tls

4. Review and Confirm the Blueprint.
   * Click “next: step 2”.
   * Verify your configuration details.

5. Deploy the Blueprint.
   * Once verified, click on the `deploy blueprint` button. You will see the deployment details along with an email stating that the Blueprint is queued for execution.
   * This will kick off the Blueprint deploy process and load a page to allow you to track the progress of the deployment.

6. Monitor the Activity Queue.
   * Monitor the Deployment Queue to view the progress of the Blueprint.
   * You can access the queue at any time by clicking the Queue link under the Blueprints menu on the main navigation drop-down menu.
   * Once the Blueprint completes successfully, you will receive an email stating that the Blueprint build is complete. Please do not use the application until you have received this email notification.

### Deploy LimeSurvey to an existing server (alternate option)

Bitnami LimeSurvey Stack is available as a Script Package for deployment on an existing server based on your own sizing requirements. The Stack also supports more advanced configurations such as customized Blueprint workflows to repeatably deploy multiple stacks on servers.

#### Steps

1. Deploy or Identify an Existing Server.
Identify the server targeted for LimeSurvey installation. The Operating system must be supported by the Script Package. See the [Creating a new enterprise cloud server](../../Servers/creating-a-new-enterprise-cloud-server.md) KB for more information on completing this step.

2. Select to Execute the Package on a Server Group.
   * Packages can be executed on one or more servers in a Group. Search for the public script package named **Install Bitnami LimeSurvey on Linux**.
   * See the [using group tasks to install scripts on groups](../../Servers/using-group-tasks-to-install-software-and-run-scripts-on-groups.md) KB for more information on how to complete the next few steps.

3. Configure the Parameters.
Set the following application parameters:

  * **Apache Web Server Port** - default 80
  * **SSL Port** - default 443
  * **Web Server domain** - default 127.0.0.1
  * **MySQL Server port** - default 3306
  * **Login** - default user
  * **Your real name** - default User Name
  * **Email Address** - default user@example.com
  * **Password**
  * **Do you want to configure mail support?** - default 0
  * **Default email provider:** - default custom
  * **SMTP User**
  * **SMTP Password**
  * **SMTP Port** - default 587
  * **SMTP Host**
  * **Secure connection** - default tls

4. Deploy the Script Package.
Once verified, click on the `execute package` button. This kicks off the deployment process and loads a page where you can track the progress. Deployment typically completes within a few minutes.

5. Monitor the Activity Queue.
   * Monitor the Deployment Queue to view the progress of the Blueprint.
   * You can access the queue at any time by clicking the Queue link under the Blueprints menu on the main navigation drop-down.
   * Once the Blueprint completes successfully, you will receive an email stating that the Blueprint build is complete. Please do not use the application until you have received this email notification.

### Access your LimeSurvey server
After your Blueprint deploys successfully, please follow these instructions to access your server:

1. Check email to obtain Server Name and IP Address Login information.
2. Log in to the server and start having fun!

### Pricing
The costs associated with this Blueprint deployment are for the CenturyLink Cloud infrastructure only. There are no Bitnami license costs or additional fees bundled in.

### About Bitnami
CenturyLink Cloud works with [Bitnami](http://www.bitnami.com) to provide open source software integrations to its customers. Bitnami is a library of popular server applications and development environments that can be installed with one click, either on your laptop, a virtual machine, or hosted in the cloud. Bitnami takes care of compiling and configuring the applications and all of their dependencies (third-party libraries, language runtimes, and databases) so they work out-of-the-box. The resulting packaged software (a 'stack') is then made available as native installers, virtual machines, and cloud images. These Bitnami application packages provide a consistent, secure ,and optimized end-user experience when deploying any app, on any platform.
