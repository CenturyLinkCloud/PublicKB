### Description
Cavirin has integrated their technology with the CenturyLink Cloud platform.  The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage of this integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for this compliance and regulatory governance solution.

Cavirin gives you visibility across your entire IT ecosystem. It supports the broadest range of devices and vendors on the market, so nothing escapes notice. It searches out outdated and unpatched servers—the number-one culprit implicated in major IT security breaches. It checks your firewall and OS configurations against best practices and regulatory policies. But it doesn’t stop there. Cavirin also monitors your accounts—ensuring tight access control, strict password and lockout policies, and unused accounts.

Technology from Cavirin helps CenturyLink Cloud customers address the business challenge of compliance and regulatory governance for their entire IT environment by providing continuous discovery and device review.  Now available as part of the CenturyLink Cloud Blueprint Engine.

It's easy!  Think of Cavirin as your operational GRC tool in the cloud.

### Solution Overview
Cavirin is a security and compliance solution expressly designed for cloud AND data center environments-the ultimate hybrid cloud solution.  Cavirin provides a range of compliance guidelines, expressly designed to measure and monitor risk associated with these compliance guidelines (PCI, HIPAA, ISO, NIST, SOC 2, CIS, and/or DISA STIGs) that are applied to your environment.  In addition to OS-level checks, Cavirin can also evaluates application-specific CIS guidelines, such as those for Microsoft IIS, Internet Explorer, SQL Server, Firefox, Oracle, and MySQL.  Lastly, we are an extremely viable solution for File Integrity Monitoring for your hybrid cloud as well.

Cavirin is designed to assist security and compliance teams who face regulatory audits, and greatly reduces the manual effort in audit preparation, execution and maintenance in perpetuity.  A key benefit of Cavirin is that it is platform-independent, and was designed to reach and support a wide range of platforms.

### Offer
Cavirin has provided their Automated Risk Analysis Platform virtual appliance - called a Partner Template - that can be deployed to your CenturyLink Cloud account via a Service Task.  Although Service Tasks are ordinarily billed to the end user account, CenturyLink will provide a refund for the Service Task costs associated with deploying the Cavirin Partner Template.  Cavirin is sold on a per device basis and broken into tiers.  We also have trial licenses available upon request.  To receive pricing for your environment and/or receive a trial license please contact Cavirin sales: [Tim Thompson, tthompson@cavirin.com](mailto:tthompson@cavirin.com) or via telephone: (469) 831-8357.

### Audience

### Impact
After executing the steps in this Getting Started document, the users will have a functioning Cavirin Automated Risk Analysis Platform (ARAP) upon which they can start developing discovery solutions.

### Prerequisite
1.  Access to the CenturyLink Cloud platform as an authorized user.
2.  Identify a Network VLAN you want the Cavirin partner template to reside on
3.  A Cavirin ARAP License.  You will need to send this to CenturyLink Support at the time of deployment.
4.    The Cavirin ARAP server will utilize the following resources.  Note: larger environments may require additional processors to allow for speed of discovery.
  *    8GB RAM
  *    2 Processors
  *    100GB disk space (can be thin provisioned)
  *    line of sight network access to devices in scope
5.    The following protocols are used for discovery
  * ICMP
  * SNMP
  * SSH
  * WMI / Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
6.    To access Windows machines you will need Administrator credentials.
7.    To access Linux machines you will need root level credentials, a PEM key file can also be used for access.
8.    If you would like to access systems outside the immediate network then there must routable access to that network either through a router or vpn.
9.    Please refer to [https://support.cavirin.com](https://support.cavirin.com) to find any additional prerequisites required for your deployment

### Postrequisite
- If you want to access your Cavirin partner template over the internet, please perform the following tasks once your VM has been deployed to your account:

1. [Add a Public IP](../../Network/how-to-add-public-ip-to-virtual-machine.md) to your server through Control Portal

2. If required, [allow incoming traffic for the admin port](../../Network/how-to-add-public-ip-to-virtual-machine.md) by clicking on the Servers Public IP in Control Portal.  Warning: Please make sure your firewall rules are properly configured to only allow specific source traffic.  If you do not configure source traffic rules you risk exposing your VM to the entire internet.
