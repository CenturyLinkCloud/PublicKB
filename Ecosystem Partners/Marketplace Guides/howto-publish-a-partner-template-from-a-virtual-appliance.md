### Description
This Knowledge Base article documents the process required for Cloud Ecosystem Program partners to upload and publish Partner Templates to customers of the CenturyLink Cloud platform using an uploaded "virtual appliance" image.

### Audience
- Cloud Ecosystem Program Members
- CenturyLink Cloud Support Personnel

### Impact
For some CenturyLink Cloud Ecosystem Program members, a Virtual Appliance or "custom image" is simply the best model for technology integration and deployment. CenturyLink Cloud Ecosystem members can upload their VMware-based image technology by following this process.

### Prerequisite
- Cloud Ecosystem Program status - must be at least Candidate
- Supplied Image Files:
    - Must meet the existing OVF image requirements
        http://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/service-tasks/requirements-for-custom-imagevm-imports
    - Should adhere to Image Best Practices
        http://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/service-tasks/best-practices-and-preparation-for-a-virtual-machineovfova-import
- Please ensure that company and product name are in any image filenames.
- Be aware that importing a virtual appliance or image is considered a billable service task by CenturyLink Cloud Support. These fees will count against an Ecosystem Partner's integration credit.
