### Description

aiScaler has integrated their technology with the CenturyLink Cloud platform.  The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage
of this integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for this application delivery controller solution.


#### aiProtect

**aiProtect** automates the identification and mitigation of Denial of Service (DoS & DDOS) attacks, while providing detailed reporting necessary to end
the attack.

It is a reverse proxy placed between your origin server and the web, that identifies attackers and blocks their requests, while reporting offending
addresses so your network provider can stop the attack.

**aiProtect** uses a unique Intelligent request throttling. It limits requesting clients to a certain number of requests per interval. For example,
aiProtect can limit a client to 20 requests per 10 seconds. This method of throttling is different from simple RPS-limiting and is much more user
friendly. If your typical page consists of 10-15 items, such a limit will allow users to view a complete page every 10 seconds, presenting no
inconvenience for a human, but preventing bots from taking down your server.

aiProtect can be run non-stop without affecting the speed of your existing application.


### Audience

CenturyLink Cloud Users
