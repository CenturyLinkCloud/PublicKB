### Description
Commvault Systems has integrated their technology with the CenturyLink Cloud platform. The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage of this integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for this Data Management solution.

Technology from Commvault Systems helps CenturyLink Cloud customers address the business challenge of data protection and data growth by implementing Commvault's Simpana data management solution - now available as part of the CenturyLink Cloud Blueprint Engine.

### Solution Overview
CommVault's holistic approach to cloud management allows you to manage your virtual infrastructure seamlessly across multiple hypervisors and cloud platforms — and to automate and streamline operations over the entire VM lifecycle, from provisioning to protection to decommissioning.

The CommVault Simpana Blueprints offer different ways to manage data in, from and to the CenturyLink Cloud as well as integrate with multiple remote data centers and cloud platforms.

The 'All in One' Blueprint includes a Windows 2012 Server image with the Simpana components to build out a new CommCell and/or attache to an existing Commcell. The image has the CommmServe and Media Agent software component ready to be configured as needed for your desired use case.

### Offer
Commvault is making their technology available for CenturyLink Cloud Users to deploy to their account. Installation of the Commvault Server and All In One Blueprints includes a license good for one month (depending on the actual date of deployment). In order to purchase a license or entitlement, please contact [Contact Commvault sales](http://www.commvault.com/contact-us).
