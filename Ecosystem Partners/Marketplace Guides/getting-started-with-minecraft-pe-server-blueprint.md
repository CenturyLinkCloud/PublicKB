### Description
CenturyLink has created a Blueprint that makes it extremely easy to spin up your own dedicated Minecraft PE (Pocket Edition) Server in minutes and play from iOS clients like iPad and iPhone. This Blueprint will automatically download, install and configure Minecraft PE Server 1.4.1 on to a new Linux server.

Advantages of running Minecraft PE Server in CenturyLink Cloud:
* Fast provisioning - get a Minecraft server running within minutes - No long term server commitment - pay as you go each month.
* On-demand Scalability - Add more CPU, Disk or Memory resources on the fly as your worlds grow.
* Save money - Run your Minecraft PE server only when you use it. You can host a server just in the evenings or weekends with your friends and not have to pay to run it 24/7 unless you chose to. You can use the CenturyLink Cloud mobile app to start and stop your Minecraft server any time, any where.
* Fast Bandwidth - Your Minecraft server has a 2GB inbound network throughput ensuring low latency game play.
* Easy backups - You can easily save your worlds anytime you choose.
* Customizable - Customize your Minecraft server by installing any mods you want!
* No advanced technical experience required - Don't worry about setting up the VM and software dependencies, we did that for you. Just run the Blueprint, add a public IP with firewall rules and start playing in minutes.
* Parental Control - Control where your family plays and who they play with by having ownership of the server.
* Secure - CenturyLink Cloud includes network security and allows you to block users from connecting to your server at a network level in addition to game whitelists.
