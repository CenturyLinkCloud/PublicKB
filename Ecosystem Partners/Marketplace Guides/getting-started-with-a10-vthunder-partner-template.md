With vThunder virtual appliances you gain a flexible and easy-to-deploy appliance featuring advanced services for any enterprises, web giant or service provider, on demand.

### Offer
A10 is making their vThunder Appliance available for CenturyLink Cloud Users to deploy to their account.  In order to purchase a license or entitlement, please contact A10 Sales using the contact information above.

### Audience
CenturyLink Cloud Users

### Impact
After reading this article, the user should feel comfortable deploying the A10 vThunder technology on CenturyLink Cloud.  A10 has provided a Virtual Appliance - what we call a Partner Template - that can be deployed to your CenturyLink Cloud account via a Service Task.

This deployment process for Partner Templates currently requires manual interaction via the Service Task process, but will be further automated in future releases of the CenturyLink Cloud Platform.

If you are interested in seeing this type of Partner Template deployment as an automated feature in the future, please share your input with us at [features@ctl.io](mailto:features@ctl.io)

### Prerequisite
- Access to the CenturyLink Cloud platform as an authorized user.
- Create a Network VLAN you want the A10 vThunder Appliance to reside on.  Creating a new VLAN follows best practices so users can secure the private VIPs with firewalls.

### Postrequisite
- If you want to access your A10 vThunder Appliance over the internet, please perform the following tasks once your A10 vThunder Appliance has been deployed to your account:

1. [Add a Public IP](../../Network/how-to-add-public-ip-to-virtual-machine.md) to your server through Control Portal

2. [Allow incoming traffic](../../Network/how-to-add-public-ip-to-virtual-machine.md) for desired ports by clicking on the Servers Public IP through Control Portal

### Detailed Steps to Deploy A10 vThunder Appliance Partner Template
Follow these step by step instructions to deploy a A10 vThunder Appliance in to your CenturyLink Cloud account:

- Open a service task request ticket via email to ServiceTasks@ctl.io with the following details.  You will need to edit some of the information below.

----
TO: ServiceTasks@ctl.io

EMAIL SUBJECT:   Custom Image Import Request for Ecosystem Partner Template

CLC Support Team,
Please create a ticket to complete the following Service Task:

Please import the Ecosystem Partner Template image file referenced below to my CenturyLink Cloud Account:
- Import CenturyLink Ecosystem Partner Source Image: “vThunder-2.7.2-P4-single-interface-v2.ova”
- My CenturyLink Cloud Account Alias: ####
-- My CenturyLink Cloud Account PIN: ####
- Data Center to import image to: ###
- Server Name to import image as: ##########
- VLAN in the account to add the Server to: ########
- Number of VIP's you'd like reserved in the network for load balancing.  (The support team can reserve more later via a ticket.  CLC Support team will reserve 10 VIPs unless stated otherwise.)

Additional Information to add Partner Template to Network:
- Please reference the A10 documentation and follow the steps below;
- During the initial install, the first interface will be used for both management and data. Please request "black hole" VLANs for interfaces 2 and 3 for the system to work correctly. This requirement will be removed in the future as vThunder is tailored for CenturyLink's Cloud.
- Boot the server up and at the command prompt:
- Login as:  admin / 10
- Enter privileged mode by running: "enable" (Just hit enter when prompted for a password)
- Enter ethernet 1 configuration area by running: "interface ethernet 1"
- Assign an IP to ethernet 1 by running: "ip address <ip> <mask>"
- Exit ethernet 1 configuration area by running: "exit"
- Add a default route by running:    "ip route 0.0.0.0 /0 <gateway>"
- Change the admin password by running: "admin admin password <password>"
(Yes, there's 2 "admin", the first is the "admin" command, the 2nd is to configure the user admin)
- Set the hostname by running: "hostname <hostname>"
- Save the configuration by running: "write memory"

- Navigate to http://<YOURVIRTUALAPPLIANCEIPADDRESS> in your web browser to confirm it is on the network

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues. Kindly send me a reply once the work has been completed and let us know the IP address of the vThunder Appliance VM.

Thank you very much, Your_Name_Here
