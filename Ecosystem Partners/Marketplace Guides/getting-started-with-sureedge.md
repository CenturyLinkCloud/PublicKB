### Description
To use SUREedge for DR or onboarding to the Cloud, you must run an instance of SUREedge both on-prem and on-CenturyLink Cloud. The on-prem instance provides the capability to capture and dedupe-replicate applications and data, while the on-cloud instance acts as the receiver, storage and recovery manager in the Cloud.
To create the on-Cloud instance, use either of these two Blueprints:
* SUREedge Migrator:  Use this for onboarding/migration to CenturyLink Cloud.
* SUREedge DR:  Use this for DR CenturyLink Cloud.

To download and create the on-prem instance, go to [http://www.surelinesystems.com/centurylink/](http://www.surelinesystems.com/centurylink/)

#### Deciding Which Blueprint to Use
There are two SUREedge Blueprints available:
* SUREedge Migrator: Use this for onboarding/migration to CenturyLink Cloud.
* SUREedge DR: Use this for DR to CenturyLink Cloud.

#### Steps to Deploy a New SUREedge Blueprint
1. Locate the Blueprint in the Blueprint Library.
   * Starting from the CenturyLink Control Panel, navigate to the Blueprints Library.
   * Search for "SUREedge" in the keyword search on the right side of the page.
   * Select either **SUREedge Migrator** or **SUREedge DR**.

2. Click the `deploy blueprint` button.

3. Set Required parameters.
   * **MC Password** - Repeat the root administrator credentials already given for the server.
   <img src="../../images/sureedge/deploy_parameters.png" style="max-width:450px;">

4. Set Optional Parameters.
   * Password/Confirm Password (This is the root password for the server. Keep this in a secure place).
   * Set DNS to “Manually Specify” and use “8.8.8.8” (or any other public DNS server of your choice).
   * Optionally set the server name prefix.
   * The default values are fine for every other option.
   * *You should note the two hostnames you specified above, as well as the MC password. These
  will be needed later to log into and configure your SUREedge instances.*

5. Review and Confirm the Blueprint.

6. Deploy the Blueprint.
   * Once verified, click the `deploy blueprint` button.
   * You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution.

7. Deployment Complete.
   * Once the Blueprint has deployed you will receive an email confirming the newly deployed assets within a few minutes.
   * If you do not receive an email you may have had a deployment error - check the *Blueprints Queue* or review the *Blueprint Build Log* to for error messages.
   * You will see two VMs running, a Windows VM and a Linux VM. The Windows VM is referred to as the `SUREedge-MC` and Linux VM as `SUREedge-Stor`.
   * Login to the [Control Portal](https://control.ctl.io) and find the public IP addresses of these two systems - you will need these later.

8. **Sizing** (optional)
   * Review the capacity planning guide available at http://www.surelinesystems.com/centurylink/ to help size the SUREedge instance correctly for your use case.

9. Complete On-Premises SUREedge Component Installation.
   * Login to the Windows VM on which you intend to install the on-prem instance of the SUREedge-MC.
   * Download the software from http://www.surelinesystems.com/centurylink/. Login to your Sureline account, or register if you are new.
   * Install the software.
   * *Note the IP address of the Windows system where you installed the on-prem SUREedge-MC module and username and password during the installation. You will need these later to login to the application.*
   * NOTE: Review the capacity planning guide to help size the SUREedge-Stor VM. Your license file will be sent by email to you by Sureline team.

10. Logging onto the on-prem instance and initiating Migration.
   * Use any browser (Firefox recommended) to connect to the IP address of the on-prem SUREedge-MC. Login using the username and password you applied during the installation.

11. Your next step is to link the two instances of the SUREedge.
   * Click on Settings → Cloud or Remote → Remote
   * Enter the Public IP/FQDN, username and password of the on-cloud SUREedge-Stor of that you noted earlier while creating the Blueprint image.
   * You are now ready to add clients and start migration. Refer to the user guide available at http://www.surelinesystems.com/resources/ on how to add clients, create plans, initiate migration, etc.

12. Logging onto the on-Cloud instance and Recovering.
   * Use any browser (Firefox recommended) to connect to the public IP address of the on-cloud SUREedge-MC instance. Login using the username and password you specified while deploying the Blueprint.
   * You will be now able to recover systems that have been replicated to CenturyLink Cloud.
   * Refer to the [User Guide](http://www.surelinesystems.com/resources/) on how to recover a system.
