### Technology Profile
Clustrix provides the leading scale-out SQL database engineered for the cloud.  It is the first database built specifically to meet the revenue scaling, performance and availability demands of today’s web sites and applications such as those for eCommerce, healthcare and finance. With ClustrixDB, you can build business critical applications that support massive transactional volume and real-time reporting of business performance metrics.

### Description
ClustrixDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL that provides simplicity of management and scaling using commodity server infrastructure. ClustrixDB offers key features for companies who need an easily managed, easily scaled RDBMS:

* First scale-out relational database designed to meet the elastic scaling requirements of high-volume online transactions needed by e-commerce and other Web applications.
* Architecture that massively scales both reads and writes, while ensuring transaction integrity.
* ACID Compliant.
* Scales linearly with a shared-nothing architecture, automated, intelligent data distribution and distributed query processing.
* “Clustered” database architecture provides automatic redundancy at deployment and assures high-availability of RDBMS across any load with automated fault recovery.
* FLEX licensing model allows deployment of additional database resources for “spikes” due to seasons, promotions or planned heavy loads.
* Code compatible with MySQL, with added benefit that adding servers (and scaling read/write capacity) requires no coding changes to application code.
* ClustrixDB is seen by the application as a single logical database, no matter how many database server nodes are deployed.
* Our patented slicing method delivers performance that is superior to that of sharding and sharding-like approaches, which are costly to manage and fragile.
* Can be deployed across geography with asynchronous replication, using MySQL replication protocol.
* Self-managing, eliminates many DBA operations tasks, significantly reducing the cost of ownership and allowing engineers to focus on innovation.
* Realtime reporting and dashboards allow developers and DBAs to quickly gauge the health of the database and workload.

Current Release is v 7.0.1 (6/15/2015)
