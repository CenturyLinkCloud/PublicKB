### Description
Coffing Data Warehousing is happy to be providing its amazing service on the Century Link Cloud platform.  The purpose of this KB article is to help you get up and running quickly with Coffing’s Nexus Chameleon data warehousing solution.

Coffing Data Warehousing, founded by Tom Coffing, has been providing data warehousing products, education and services since 1993.  Tom and his teams have written over 50 books on data warehousing and have taught 1,000s of classes on every major data warehouse vendor.  The Nexus Chameleon combines these years of experience to provide users the ability to analyze, visualize, compare, compress and move data between many disparate data warehousing systems.  Coffing’s latest achievement allows users to join data between SQL Server, Oracle, and Teradata via a simple point and click interface.

The Nexus Chameleon helps CenturyLink Cloud customers by unifying their data warehousing environment under one software solution.  Multiple tools for multiple systems are no longer needed and this solution is not available to everyone as part of the CenturyLink Cloud Blueprint Engine.

CoffingDW solutions have helped provide the largest data warehouses in the world increased cost savings, productivity, and efficiency.

### Solution Overview
Nexus is a world-class business intelligence tool that provides serious insight into every major database system in your enterprise. It was designed to unite your enterprise and was designed for the most powerful and popular data sources including Redshift, Hadoop, Oracle, SQL Server, Teradata, Asterdata, Netezza, DB2, Kognitio, Vertica, Greenplum, Sybase ASE, ParAccel and Excel.

The amazing Super Join Builder's drag and drop interface allows users to create queries with the click of a mouse and could be the easiest, fastest and most efficient way to do a cross-system join between Teradata, SQL Server and Oracle ever created! The Super Join Builder also creates advanced analytic functions, group by rollup, and group by grouping sets in seconds. It allows companies to load their ERwin model and displays relationships visually so that everyone has the knowledge of the enterprise's data model at their fingertips. Nexus even allows users to create their own custom joins so even the most novice SQL developer looks like an expert!

The new Garden of Analysis will perform deep analytics on any data set using local cpu and disk, saving these valuable resources on the main system. It will even stream data between Oracle, SQL Server and Teradata and then convert the DDL from one system to the other. The process of manually converting DDL, building ETL scripts and then moving this data could take weeks of work by expensive consultants. Nexus can do this in seconds with only a few clicks!
