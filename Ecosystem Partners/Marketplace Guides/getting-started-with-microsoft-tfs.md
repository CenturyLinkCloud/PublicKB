### Technology Profile
Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2013 (TFS 2013) provides the collaboration hub at the center of the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) solution. By automating the software delivery process, entire teams can collaborate across roles and track team actions and project artifacts such as requirements, tasks, bugs, source code, build results, and test results. Team Foundation Server 2013 enables team rooms, comprehensive reporting, and dashboards that provide historical trending, full traceability, and real-time visibility into software quality.

### Description
This KB article describes the options for installing and configuring TFS 2013 on the CenturyLink Cloud using Blueprints.

Due to the complexities of the possible TFS 2013 configurations, there are several TFS 2013 Blueprints available to allow you to achieve your required scenario.
* Team Foundation Server 2013 Standalone Small
* Team Foundation Server 2013 Standalone Medium
* Team Foundation Server 2013 Standalone Large
* Team Foundation Server 2013 Basic with SQL Server Express
* Team Foundation Server 2013 with SQL Server

The following software is installed by all TFS 2013 Blueprints -
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard 64-bit
* Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2013 with Update 5
* Team Explorer for Microsoft Visual Studio 2013

*Team Explorer is the client software that you use to access Team Foundation Server 2013 functionality from Visual Studio.*

#### Microsoft Documentation ###
For more information about configuring TFS 2013, see the following Microsoft documentation -

[Set up TFS on a server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh561426(v=vs.120).aspx).

#### Blueprint - Team Foundation Server 2013 Standalone
There are three variations on this Blueprint - Small, Medium, and Large.
* Small - 2 CPU 8 GB memory
* Medium - 4 CPU 16 GB memory
* Large - 4 CPU 32 GB memory

These Blueprints provide a Windows 2008 R2 Standard server with TFS 2013 installed - but not configured. They do not install SQL Server. You can then configure any of the possible TFS 2013 configurations using the "Team Foundation Server Administration Console".

If SQL Server is required for the TFS configuration (Basic or Standard) you can install SQL Server either locally or remotely, and you can select the SQL Server you require. You can use the "Install SQL Server on Existing Server" Blueprint to install SQL Server. The user should select either SQL Server 2014 Standard or Enterprise.

#### Blueprint - Team Foundation Server 2013 Basic with SQL Server Express
This Blueprint installs TFS 2013 and performs the Basic configuration, which installs SQL Server Express 2012.

#### Blueprint - Team Foundation Server 2013 with SQL Server
This Blueprint installs (a full edition of) SQL Server and TFS 2013. The user should select either SQL Server 2014 Standard or Enterprise.

### Access your TFS 2013 server
To access your TFS 2013 server from a computer outside the CenturyLink Cloud network use the OpenVPN client as specified here: [How To Configure Client VPN](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/network/how-to-configure-client-vpn/).

### Pricing
The costs associated with this Blueprint deployment include CenturyLink Cloud infrastructure usage.

Additional licensing costs will apply for Microsoft software, including TFS 2013 and SQL Server. If you deploy with SQL Server, charges will apply for SQL Server. See the article [install SQL Server](../../Blueprints/deploy-microsoft-sql-server-using-blueprint.md) for information on how to install SQL Server if you have any questions. This Blueprint is automatically run if you choose the Blueprint, **Blueprint - Team Foundation Server 2013 with SQL Server**.

The TFS 2013 license is not included. You can choose to configure TFS 2013 on first use with a 90-day trial license, or you can enter your license key. A trial license can be upgraded to a full license at a later time by providing your license key. **You must obtain an appropriate license for TFS from Microsoft and enter the license key. TFS is not purchased through installing this Blueprint.**
