### Description
Pivotal has integrated their Greenplum technology with the CenturyLink Cloud platform. The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage of this integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for this Greenplum solution.

Greenplum incorporates key performance capabilities, flexible data analytics, enterprise grade robustness, seamless integration with analytics stacks and a database management framework focused on reducing total cost of ownership.

### Audience
CenturyLink Cloud Users who will need to repeatedly deploy a Pivotal Greenplum cluster larger than that described in the [deploying a Pivotal Greenplum cluster](getting-started-with-pivotal-greenplum-blueprint.md) document. If this will be a one time build then adding additional nodes using the expansion Blueprint may be easier.


### Creating a custom Blueprint
Single button deploy of an arbitrary sized Pivotal Greenplum cluster.

#### Steps
1. Review creating a new Blueprint referencing the [How to build a Blueprint KB](../../Blueprints/how-to-build-a-blueprint.md), if necessary.
   * (Wizard step 1) Complete as normal.
   * (Wizard step 2) Do not add any servers in this step.

2. (Wizard step 3) Add new cluster Blueprint.
   * Add a single new cluster to the Blueprint and any number of additional nodes. Take note that if deploying your cluster in a mirrored configuration then an even number of nodes must be added.
