### Description
SoftNAS has integrated their Cloud File Gateway and NAS technology with the CenturyLink Cloud platform, publishing their virtual appliance as a CenturyLink Cloud Partner Template.  The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage of this integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for this encryption solution.

For more information including whitepapers and data sheets, please view the product information and documentation on [SoftNAS website](https://www.softnas.com/wp/support/documentation/).

### Solution Overview
SoftNAS Cloud is an enterprise-grade, full-featured cloud NAS filer and cloud storage gateway. Safely migrate business-critical applications to the CenturyLink Cloud without a physical storage appliance. Quick and easy to deploy, any IT professional can install and configure SoftNAS in minutes without specialized training. High-availability is included at no extra cost for CenturyLink Cloud users who deploy the two requisite instances.

SoftNAS Cloud runs as a Linux-based, 64-bit CentOS redistribution guest OS, treated as a VM in a virtual server environment. In many use cases, storage devices are attached to the physical hardware layer, then presented to SoftNAS Cloud as a VM running Linux.

SoftNAS Cloud operates on an industry-standard Linux platform, and uses a derivative of the Zettabyte File System (ZFS). This makes SoftNAS Cloud able to leverage many ZFS features and add layers of functionality for NAS solutions in virtual computing and cloud computing.

An Apache webserver provides robust, secure access along with Secure Shell (SSH). Storage is accessible via TCP/IP protocols including NFS v3, NFS v4, SMB/CIFS (Microsoft Windows File Shares), and iSCSI.

SoftNAS Cloud is packaged with a primary administration interface called SoftNAS StorageCenter, which provides commercial-grade storage administration and management functionalities for businesses of all sizes.

#### Key Features:
- NFS, CIFS and iSCSI support
- Connects to popular Cloud Storage services
- 99.999% reliability with cross-zone high-availability with SNAP HA(tm)
- Cross-region block replication with SnapReplicate(tm)
- Active Directory integration
- Compression, deduplication, thin-provisioning
- Easy set-up and configuration wizards, intuitive admin interface (StorageCenter)

SoftNAS has provided a Virtual Appliance - called a Partner Template - that can be deployed to your CenturyLink Cloud account via a Service Task.  Although Service Tasks are ordinarily billed to the end user account, CenturyLink will provide a refund for the Service Task costs associated with deploying the Partner Template.  Please follow the process below to request credit.

### Audience
CenturyLink Cloud Users, Storage Administrators, IT Managers

### Impact
After reading this article, the user should feel comfortable deploying the SoftNAS Cloud File Gateway technology on CenturyLink Cloud.  SoftNAS has provided a Virtual Appliance, what CenturyLink Cloud calls a Partner Template, that can be deployed to your CenturyLink Cloud account via a Service Task.

This deployment process for Partner Templates currently requires manual interaction via the Service Task process, but will be further automated in future releases of the CenturyLink Cloud Platform.

### Prerequisite
- Access to the CenturyLink Cloud platform as an authorized user.
- Identify a Network VLAN you want the SoftNAS instance/s to reside on
- Do you want to deploy this in a high availability configuration?  Typically, most users _do not_ deploy a HA configuration, but if you want to there are a few things you should be aware of.  For starters, a SoftNAS HA configuration will consist of 3 SoftNAS appliances.  The primary and secondary will reside in separate data centers and the third will reside in the same data center as the primary.  For more information on SoftNAS high availaility architecture details, please contact [SoftNAS Support](mailto:support@softnas.com).

### Postrequisite
1.  Make sure you add additional raw storage to the SoftNAS VM via the Control Portal as outlined in the Accessing and using your SoftNAS Cloud Gateway section of this article.

2. If you want to access your VM over the internet, please perform the following tasks once you receive an email confirming you Blueprint completed successfully:

  1. Add a [Public IP](../../Network/how-to-add-public-ip-to-virtual-machine.md) to your server through Control Portal. Alternatively, you can [setup a VPN using OpenVPN](../../Network/how-to-configure-client-vpn.md) or similar technology.

3. [Allow incoming traffic](../../Network/how-to-add-public-ip-to-virtual-machine.md) for ports below:
  - For administrative access and use, open the following ports:
    * TCP Ports: 443
    * UDP Ports: 1
    * ICMP: All

  - For CIFS Sharing, open the following ports:
    * TCP 137, 138, 139, 445
    * TCP 389 for Active Directory
    * TCP 445 for NetBIOS Post-Windows 2000 (CIFS)
    * TCP 901 for SWAT

  - For NFS Sharing, open the following ports:
    * TCP 111, 2010-2014, 2049
    * UDP 111, 2010-2014, 2049
