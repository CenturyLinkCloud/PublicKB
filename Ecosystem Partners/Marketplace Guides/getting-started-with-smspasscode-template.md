#### Steps to Complete Installation
Once the Template is copied and server is created, complete the following steps to complete the SMS Passcode installation:

  1. Log into the new server, using administrator + password used when server was instantiated.

  2. Close/minimize the server manager, which will be open per default.

  3. From the start menu, launch the SMS PASSCODE configuration tool and browse to the Network tab, change the shared secret (password) to something customer unique (min 15 chars).

The Configuration Tool  <this doesn't seem to make sense>

The shared secret on the Network tab <this doesn't seem to make sense>


  4. On the configuration tool Database tab, change the hostname to the hostname of the new instance (if in doubt, open command prompt, type hostname).

    - Note that if you hit the test button on the database test now, the test will fail, this is okay as the cause is fixed in the next steps.

  5. Launch the web admin interface (http://localhost:2000) and:

  6. Navigate to Hosts > Authentication Hosts > Edit > insert new current hostname here as well.

  7. Navigate to Hosts > Transmitter Hosts > Edit, insert new current hostname here too. You can now re-run the config tool and verify the database test works at this point.

  8. Navigate to Settings > License and paste in the new license number (long hex string) as received from SMS Passcode corp. The console will (depending on issued license) prompt for the following information:
     - "The license key contains one or more new CAL types. You may grant these new CAL types manually, e.g. by mantaining the license grants on your User Group Policies. Or alternatively, you may select the CAL types below, that you would like to grant to all users immediately. Select the CAL types to grant to all users immediately"

  9. Check all options that apply (this will typically be: MFA standard)

From here, there are two additional steps to complete provisioning of a new CenturyLink SMS Passcode setup:

  10.  Configure one or more of the following:
    - Web service dispatchers
    - E-mail dispatchers
    - Hardware SMS Gateways to be able to send out text messsages/voice number calls to mobile devices or e-mails.
    - For setting up a Web Dispatcher with Nexmo, refer to the attached installation guide. <What guide? need a link>

  11.  Install the necessary authentication clients on other servers. These are all documented in detail in the SMS Passcode administrative guide, <need link>

### Pricing
The costs associated with this Blueprint deployment are for the CenturyLink Cloud infrastructure only.  SMS PASSCODE Multifactor Authentication is priced on a per user per month basis for the number of users you will be protecting with SMS PASSCODE.  Pricing is $3.50 per user per month regardless of what that user is protecting (including Citrix, VPN, Remote Desktop, Windows Login, etc.) <is it a good idea to put pricing here? what if it changes?>
After deploying this template, the user can secure entitlements to the technology by sending a request via e-mail to: dad@smspasscode.com.
