* Data Security. Security is a top concern when business data is taken to the cloud. Company's private data could be compromised if the solution lacks the right features.
* Restore Capabilities. Backup data stored at a remote facility should be always at a recoverable state, accessible at any time, and allow point-in-time object-level restore.
