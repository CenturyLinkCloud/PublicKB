### Solution Overview
The best way to protect web applications is with a Web Application Firewall, or WAF. WAFs interrogate web traffic in context with how web applications work and identify everything bad, even traffic coming from a known, good source. So why doesn’t everyone have a WAF? Because monitoring, managing and tuning a WAF so it only identifies that bad traffic is hard. That is, until Alert Logic Web Security Manager.

Web Security Manager is a Web Application Firewall that is implemented in the network as a filtering gateway which validates all requests to the web systems. Web Security Manager defends against all OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities, supports XML web services and provides full PCI DSS Section 6.6 requirements compliance. Additionally, Web Security Manager includes ActiveWatch Services that provide monitoring, tuning and incident response 24×7.

Web Security Manager includes a hardened OS and installs on most standard hardware.  The Web Security Manager software appliance installer turns a piece of general purpose application server hardware into a dedicated application acceleration and security gateway within minutes - with minimal interaction.

The Web Security Manager software appliance combines the flexibility and scalability advantages of software with the security advantages and administrative simplicity from dedicated hardware appliances.

Automated application profiling, adaptive learning, positive and negative filtering and support for XML based web services allow for out of the box protection against attacks from malicious hackers and worms.

As your websites are learned Web Security Manager gradually turns towards a positive, white-list based, policy providing protection against attacks targeting undisclosed vulnerabilities in standard software and custom built applications.
