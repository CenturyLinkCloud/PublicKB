### Overview

DataStax has integrated their technology with the CenturyLink Cloud platform.  The purpose of this KB article is to help CenturyLink Cloud users understand how to successfully deploy the DataStax technology in their CenturyLink Cloud account through automated Blueprints.

DataStax makes an enterprise offering that will deploy a Cassandra cluster to enable customers to perform big data analysis.  DataStax and CenturyLink have collaborated to integrate their technologies by developing Blueprints.  The DataStax Blueprints make it easy to get up and running quickly with a pre-configured and tuned starter cluster managed by the DataStax OpsCenter tool.

Data Stax has 3 Blueprints available:

1. **DataStax Enterprise Starter Cluster Blueprint**

  Will deploy DataStax OpsCenter, which will be used to install and manage the DSE database itself, and also to add additional nodes to the cluster once they have been created in the CenturyLink cloud with the DataStax Enterprise Node Blueprint.
2. **DataStax Enterprise Additional Node Blueprint**

  Will deploy 1 DataStax Enterprise Node on CenturyLink Hyperscale server.  This node can be added to an existing cluster.
3. **DataStax Enterprise Additional DC Blueprint**

  Intended to be run on as an additional DC and does not include OpsCenter. This Blueprint will deploy high performance Hyperscale nodes and anti-affinity pools to create a five-node cluster equipped with locally attached solid state flash storage (SSD). This ensures efficient cluster operations by providing extremely low-latency response times for random reads while supplying ample sequential write performance for compaction and flush operations.
