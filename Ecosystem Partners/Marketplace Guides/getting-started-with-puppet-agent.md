### Description
Puppet agent integration is now supported on the CenturyLink Cloud platform. The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage of this integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for this solution.

Open Source Puppet is a declarative, model-based configuration management solution that lets you define the state of your IT infrastructure, using the Puppet language. Open Source Puppet then automatically enforces the correct configuration to ensure the right services are up and running, on the right platforms.

You can run Puppet on all major Linux and Unix platforms, Mac OS X, and Windows. It is available to download and use under the Apache 2.0 license.

### Audience

CenturyLink Cloud Users
### Deploying via Blueprint Packages
Puppet agents are often best deployed as part of a new server build, especially when designed a standardized infrastructure service catalog. CenturyLink has made two packages available for inclusion in your own Blueprints:
* [Install Puppet Agent Bridge on Linux](https://control.ctl.io/Blueprints/Packages/Details?uuid=775bb824-579d-4c8d-8955-c69a94a2ba1a&classification=Script&type=AccountLibrary).
* [Install Puppet Agent Bridge on Windows](https://control.ctl.io/Blueprints/Packages/Details?uuid=735bb844-579d-4c8d-8255-c69a94a2ba1a&classification=Script&type=AccountLibrary).

Both of these take a single parameter as design-time that defines the FQDN for your preferred Puppet Master. This setting is retained and need not
be resupplied with each deployment.

### Deploying on an Existing Server using Blueprints
Add a Puppet Agent to an existing Linux server using the preconfigured Blueprint.

#### Steps
1. Locate the Blueprint in the Blueprint Library.
   * Starting from the CenturyLink Control Panel, navigate to the Blueprints Library.
   * Search for “Puppet Agent” in the keyword search on the right side of the page.

   * **Execute on Server** - Select the existing server on which to execute this Blueprint

4. Review and Confirm the Blueprint.

5. Deploy the Blueprint.
   * Once verified, click the `deploy blueprint` button.
   * You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution.
   * This will kick off the Blueprint deploy process and load a page where you can track the deployment progress. Deployment will typically complete within 15 to 20 minutes.
