  * **MapR User Password** - The password you will use to log on to the MapR Control System, the Installer, or the mapr Linux user.
  * **Cluster Name ** - The name of the cluster used for filesystem names and NFS published volumes.

5. **Set Optional Parameters**

  Password/Confirm Password (This is the root password for the server. Keep this in a secure place).  

  Set DNS to “Manually Specify” and use “8.8.8.8” (or any other public DNS server of your choice).

  Optionally set the server name prefix.

  The default values are fine for every other option.

6. **Review and Confirm the Blueprint**

7. **Deploy the Blueprint**

  Once verified, click on the `deploy blueprint` button. You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution.

  This will kick off the Blueprint deploy process and load a page where you can track the deployment progress. Deployment will typically complete within five minutes.

  Servers are built using private IPs only with access with client or IPSEC VPN.  For access from the Internet at large add a public IP to your master server.
  This service will require access to 8443/TCP and 9443/TCP.
