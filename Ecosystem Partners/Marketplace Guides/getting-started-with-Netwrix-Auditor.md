### Audience
CenturyLink Cloud Users

### Impact
After reading this article, the user should feel comfortable getting started using the Netwrix Auditor Blueprint on CenturyLink Cloud.

### Prerequisite
- Access to the CenturyLink Cloud platform as an authorized user.

### Important notes
- For full featured auditing we recommend to have the Microsoft Active Directory set up in the same VLAN as the deployed Netwrix Auditor Blueprint.
- The Blueprint is configured for minimal footprint with hardware configuration sufficient for evaluation. However, in production environments, we suggest extending resources to 2CPUs and 8GB RAM. Also data drive N: should be increased up to 2TB. In addition for adequate performance external MS SQL should be used.
- The Netwrix Auditor Blueprint comes with 20 days evaluation license. To apply for full licenses please [__fill in this form__](https://start.netwrix.com/netwrix_auditor_blueprint.html)
