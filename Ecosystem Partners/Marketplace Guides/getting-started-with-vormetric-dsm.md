### Description
Vormetric has integrated their Data Security Manager (DSM) technology with the CenturyLink Cloud platform, publishing their virtual appliance as a CenturyLink Cloud Partner Template.  The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage of this integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for this encryption solution.

Together, Vormetric and CenturyLink deliver data-centric security services that encrypts sensitive customer data and centralizes encryption key management and policy control for data-at-rest encryption, privileged user access control and value security intelligence to meet customerâ€™s business and compliance requirements.

The Data-centric Security-as-a-Service (DSaaS) solution enables IT organizations to efficiently deploy data-centric security across CenturyLink Partner Templates with the Vormetric Transparent Encryption SW agents and the Vormetric Data Security Manager products.  Now, IT security managers can define what files and folders are restricted, who is allowed to view the data, when access is allowed and what operations can be performed by the individual or group.  With the Vormetric data security solution, businesses now reduce their data breach risk, guard against unauthorized data access, meet executive data privacy business requirements and satisfy security compliance regulations that govern your market.

Below is a solution diagram illustrating the Data Security Manager (DSM) deployment options available using the DSM, and also include [Vormetric Agent integrations that can be automatically deployed via CenturyLink Cloud Blueprints](getting-started-with-vormetric-encryption-agent-deployment-blueprints.md).

### Solution Overview
The Vormetric Data Security Manager (DSM) is the brain of the Vormetric Data Security Platform. The Vormetric Data Security Manager is a data security appliance which enables centralizes policy control and key management for data-at-rest-encryption, privileged user access control and security intelligence across an organization.  The Data Security Manager changes the data security management game by enabling an IT organization to have a consistent and repeatable method for encrypting, enforcing access policies and gaining security intelligence for all structured and unstructured data. Once the Data Security Manager is in place, new security mandates, compliance requirements and risks are quickly met through the provisioning of Vormetric Transparent Encryption, Vormetric Application Encryption, or managing keys and certificates for 3rd party devices. The result of centralizing control of such a breadth of data-at-rest security capabilities is low total cost of ownership, efficient deployment of new secure services, and an increase in control and visibility of data across your organization.
