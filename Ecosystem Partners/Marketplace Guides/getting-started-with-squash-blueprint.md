### Description
After reading this article, the reader should feel comfortable deploying the Squash stack (version 20150210-1) by Bitnami.

<a href="https://bitnami.com/" rel="no-follow">Bitnami</a> has integrated their <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/squash" rel="no-follow">Squash stack</a> with the CenturyLink Cloud platform with a single-click deploy solution. The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage of this integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for this Squash solution.

Squash is a collection of tools that help engineers find and kill bugs in their code by automatically collecting, collating and analyzing run time exceptions. Squash consists of the following components: Client libraries for different systems (Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Cocoa with Objective-C, etc.) catch and record errors when they occur, then send them to the API endpoint. Client libraries can be found under the SquareSquash organization. Front-end: This website displays Bug information and helps the engineer find the root cause for a Bug, and fix it. It also lets engineers manage, assign, and comment on Bugs, as well as view statistics about the Bug. API endpoints: These routes (part of the front-end app) receive exception notifications from the client libraries and process them.

### Deploying Squash on a New Server
Squash is available as a Blueprint for deployment on a **new server**.

#### Steps
1. Locate the Blueprint in the Blueprint Library.
   * Starting from the CenturyLink Control Panel, navigate to the Blueprints Library.
   * Search for **Squash on Linux** in the keyword search on the right side of the page.

2. Click the `deploy blueprint` button.

3. Set Required parameters.
    Set the following parameters in addition to those associated with your server itself (password, network, group, etc.).

   * **Service Password** -  Provide service password 6 chars or more
   * **Apache server SSL port** - default 443
   * **Postgres port** -  Database Server port default 5432
   * **Apache server port** - default 80
   * **User's name** -  Users Name
   * **Subversion port** -  Subversion Server port default 3690

5. Review and Confirm the Blueprint.

6. Deploy the Blueprint.
   * Once verified, click the `deploy blueprint` button.
   * You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution.
   * This will kick off the Blueprint deploy process and load a page where you can track the deployment progress. Deployment will typically complete within five minutes.

7. Deployment Complete.
   * Once the Blueprint has finished executing on your server you may access Squash by navigating to your server via http.

8. Enable public access (optional).
   * Servers are built using private IPs only with access with client or IPSEC VPN.
   * For inbound access from the Internet add a public IP to your master server.

### Deploying Squash on an existing server (alternate option)
Squash is available as a Blueprint Package for deployment on an existing server based on your own sizing requirements or to support more advanced configurations such as customized Blueprint Workflows to repeatably deploy multiple stacks on the same machines.

#### Steps
1. **Deploy or Identify an Existing Server**
   * Identify the server targeted for Squash installation. The operating system must be Linux.
   * See the [Creating a new enterprise cloud server](../../Servers/creating-a-new-enterprise-cloud-server.md) KB for more information on completing this step.

2. Select to Execute the Package on a Server Group.
   * Packages can be executed on one more more servers in a group.
   * Search for the public script package named **Install Squash on Linux**.
   * See the [using group tasks to install scripts on groups](../../Servers/using-group-tasks-to-install-software-and-run-scripts-on-groups.md) KB for more information on how to complete the next few steps.

3. Set Parameters.
   Set the following parameters:

   * **Service Password** -  Provide service password 6 chars or more
   * **Apache server SSL port** - default 443
   * **Postgres port** -  Database Server port default 5432
   * **Apache server port** - default 80
   * **User's name** -  Users Name
   * **Subversion port** -  Subversion Server port default 3690

4. **Deploy the Blueprint**
   * Once verified, click the `execute package` button.
   * You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution.
   * This will kick off the Blueprint deploy process and load a page where you can track the deployment progress. Deployment will typically complete within five minutes.

5. Deployment Complete.
   * Once the Blueprint has finished executing on your server you may access Squash by navigating to your server via http.

6. Enable public access (optional).
   * Servers are built using private IPs only with access with client or IPSEC VPN.
   * For inbound access from the Internet add a public IP to your master server.

### About Bitnami
CenturyLink Cloud works with [Bitnami](http://www.bitnami.com) to provide open source software integrations to its customers. Bitnami is a library of popular server applications and development environments that can be installed with one click, either in your laptop, in a virtual machine or hosted in the cloud. Bitnami takes care of compiling and configuring the applications and all of their dependencies (third-party libraries, language runtimes, databases) so they work out-of-the-box. The resulting packaged software (a 'stack') is then made available as native installers, virtual machines and cloud images. These Bitnami application packages provide a consistent, secure and optimized end-user experience when deploying any app, on any platform.

### Frequently Asked Questions
**Who should I contact for support?**
* For issues related to cloud infrastructure, please open a ticket using the [CenturyLink Cloud Support Process](../../Support/how-do-i-report-a-support-issue.md).
* For issues related to deploying the Bitnami Blueprint on CenturyLink Cloud, Licensing or Accessing the deployed software, please visit the [Bitnami Support website](http://www.bitnami.com/support).

**How do I access Squash for the first time?**
Nearly all Bitnami stacks can be accessed and configured by navigating to your server with a web browser.
