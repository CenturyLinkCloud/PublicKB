### Description

HPE has integrated their technology with the CenturyLink Cloud platform.  The purpose of this KB article is to help the reader take advantage of this 
integration to achieve rapid time-to-value for the HPE LoadRunner, the market leader for load and performance testing solution.

LoadRunner is a single load testing tool for mobile, web, and legacy applications to provide an accurate view of end-to-end system performance so that 
you can identify and fix any issues before go-live. LoadRunner is extremely flexible and generates real life loads that help you identify performance 
problems and deliver higher quality applications as early as possible during the development process. It allows you to generate real-life loads, 
identify and diagnose problems and deploy with confidence.

Technology from HPE helps CenturyLink Cloud customers address the business challenge of capacity and performance management by implementing HP 
Load Runner solution - now available as part of the CenturyLink Cloud Blueprint Engine.


### Solution Overview

HPE LoadRunner software is the industry-standard software for performance engineering. With an intuitive record and playback mechanism, 
including the patented TruClient technology, HP LoadRunner captures and produces real business processes that users would perform in production, 
at massive scale. During a test, LoadRunner captures end-user response times for business processes and transactions to determine whether the 
application can meet the required service-level agreements, and correlates this information against application infrastructure metrics to provide 
a complete picture of the potential bottlenecks in your system. LoadRunner provides an automated solution to validate that your application is built 
for better performance and reliability.


LoadRunner helps you:
* Test a broad range of applications, including the latest Web and Mobile technologies, ERP/CRM applications, and many legacy systems.
* Run high-scale tests using minimal hardware across physical, virtual and public Cloud infrastructure.
* Identify end-to end performance bottlenecks using advanced monitoring and analysis tools to ensure that new or changed applications 
  meet the performance requirements of your business
