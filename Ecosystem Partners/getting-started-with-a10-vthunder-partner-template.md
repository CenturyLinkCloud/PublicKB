- Open a service task request ticket via email to ServiceTasks@Tier3.com with the following details.  You will need to edit some of the information below.

----
TO: ServiceTasks@Tier3.com

EMAIL SUBJECT:   Custom Image Import Request for Ecosystem Partner Template
    
CLC Support Team,
Please create a ticket to complete the following Service Task:

Please import the Ecosystem Partner Template image file referenced below to my CenturyLink Cloud Account:
- Import CenturyLink Ecosystem Partner Source Image: “vThunder-2.7.2-P4-single-interface-v2.ova”
- My CenturyLink Cloud Account Alias: ####
- Data Center to import image to: ###

- VLAN in the account to add the Server to: ########
- Number of VIP's you'd like reserved in the network for load balancing.  (The support team can reserve more later via a ticket.  CLC Support team will reserve 10 VIPs unless stated otherwise.)

Additional Information to add Partner Template to Network:
- Please reference the A10 documentation and follow the steps below; 
- During the initial install, the first interface will be used for both management and data. Please request "black hole" VLANs for interfaces 2 and 3 for the system to work correctly. This requirement will be removed in the future as vThunder is tailored for CenturyLink's Cloud.
- Boot the server up and at the command prompt:
- Login as:  admin / 10
- Enter privileged mode by running: "enable" (Just hit enter when prompted for a password)
- Enter ethernet 1 configuration area by running: "interface ethernet 1"
- Assign an IP to ethernet 1 by running: "ip address <ip> <mask>"
- Exit ethernet 1 configuration area by running: "exit"
- Add a default route by running:	"ip route 0.0.0.0 /0 <gateway>"
- Change the admin password by running: "admin admin password <password>"
(Yes, there's 2 "admin", the first is the "admin" command, the 2nd is to configure the user admin)
- Set the hostname by running: "hostname <hostname>"
- Save the configuration by running: "write memory"

- Navigate to http://<YOURVIRTUALAPPLIANCEIPADDRESS> in your web browser to confirm it is on the network

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues. Kindly send me a reply once the work has been completed and let us know the IP address of the vThunder Appliance VM.

Thank you very much, Your_Name_Here
