### Technology Profile

The GitLab open source edition, available from Bitnami, is a developer tool that allows users to collaborate on code, create new projects, manage repositories, and perform code reviews. When using GitLab, users can keep their code on their own servers, either in the cloud or on-premise. For additional peace of mind, the free community edition even features enterprise-grade features such as a mature user permissions scheme and support for high availability. Bitnami GitLab is bundled with GitLab CI, a continuous integration server. Just point your projects at the CI server and automate all your tests.

### About Bitnami
CenturyLink Cloud works with [Bitnami](http://www.bitnami.com) to provide open source software integrations to its customers.  Bitnami is a library of popular server applications and development environments that can be installed with one click, either in your laptop, in a virtual machine or hosted in the cloud. Bitnami takes care of compiling and configuring the applications and all of their dependencies (third-party libraries, language runtimes, databases) so they work out-of-the-box. The resulting packaged software (a 'stack') is then made available as native installers, virtual machines and cloud images. These Bitnami application packages provide a consistent, secure and optimized end-user experience when deploying any app, on any platform.
