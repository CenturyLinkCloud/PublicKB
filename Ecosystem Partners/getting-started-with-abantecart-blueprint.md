### Deploying AbanteCart on a New Server

AbanteCart is available as a Blueprint for deployment on a **new server**.

#### Steps

  Starting from the CenturyLink Control Panel, navigate to the Blueprints Library. Search for **AbanteCart on Linux** in the keyword search on the right side of the page.

2. **Click the Deploy Blueprint button.**

3. **Set Required parameters.**

  Set the following parameters in addition to those associated with your server itself (password, network, group, etc.):

  * **Apache server SSL port** - default 443
  * **Apache server port** - default 80
  * **Service Password** -  Provide service password 6 chars or more 
  * **User's name** -  Users Name 

5. **Review and Confirm the Blueprint**

6. **Deploy the Blueprint**

  Once verified, click on the `deploy blueprint` button. You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution.

  This will kick off the Blueprint deploy process and load a page where you can track the deployment progress. Deployment will typically complete within five minutes.

7. **Deployment Complete**

  Once the Blueprint has finished executing on your server you may access AbanteCart by navigating to your server via http.

8. **Enable public access** (optional)

  Servers are built using private IPs only with access with client or IPSEC VPN.  For inbound access from the Internet add a public IP to your master server.

### About Bitnami

CenturyLink Cloud works with [Bitnami](http://www.bitnami.com) to provide open source software integrations to its customers.  Bitnami is a library of popular server applications and development environments that can be installed with one click, either in your laptop, in a virtual machine or hosted in the cloud. Bitnami takes care of compiling and configuring the applications and all of their dependencies (third-party libraries, language runtimes, databases) so they work out-of-the-box. The resulting packaged software (a 'stack') is then made available as native installers, virtual machines and cloud images. These Bitnami application packages provide a consistent, secure and optimized end-user experience when deploying any app, on any platform.
