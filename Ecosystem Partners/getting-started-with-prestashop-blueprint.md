### Deploying PrestaShop on a New Server

PrestaShop is available as a Blueprint for deployment on a **new server**.

#### Steps


1. **Locate the Blueprint in the Blueprint Library**

  Starting from the CenturyLink Control Panel, navigate to the Blueprints Library. Search for **PrestaShop on Linux** in the keyword search on the right side of the page.

2. **Click the Deploy Blueprint button.**

3. **Set Required parameters.**

  Set the following parameters in addition to those associated with your server itself (password, network, group, etc.):

  * **Apache server SSL port** - default 443
  * **Apache server port** - default 80
  * **Service Password** -  Provide service password 6 chars or more 
  * **Site** -  Hostname default 127.0.0.1
  * **User's name** -  Users Name 

5. **Review and Confirm the Blueprint**

6. **Deploy the Blueprint**

  Once verified, click on the `deploy blueprint` button. You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution.

  This will kick off the Blueprint deploy process and load a page where you can track the deployment progress. Deployment will typically complete within five minutes.

  Once the Blueprint has finished executing on your server you may access PrestaShop by navigating to your server via http.

8. **Enable public access** (optional)

  Servers are built using private IPs only with access with client or IPSEC VPN.  For inbound access from the Internet add a public IP to your master server.

### About Bitnami

CenturyLink Cloud works with [Bitnami](http://www.bitnami.com) to provide open source software integrations to its customers.  Bitnami is a library of popular server applications and development environments that can be installed with one click, either in your laptop, in a virtual machine or hosted in the cloud. Bitnami takes care of compiling and configuring the applications and all of their dependencies (third-party libraries, language runtimes, databases) so they work out-of-the-box. The resulting packaged software (a 'stack') is then made available as native installers, virtual machines and cloud images. These Bitnami application packages provide a consistent, secure and optimized end-user experience when deploying any app, on any platform.
