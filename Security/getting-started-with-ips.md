### Overview
The Platform CenturyLink IPS utilizes an Agent installed on your Virtual Machine (VM) that monitors the VM for suspicious activity. If suspicious activity is found, the Agent logs the activity, which it may block or stop, and reports the incident based on the IPS policy. There is a default policy associated with each VM that is automatically tuned based on the host operating system and installed applications.

This Blueprint is for the actual installation and activation of the IPS service on the VM. Other Blueprints will be available for modifications to the installation.

### Prerequisites
* A CenturyLink Cloud Account
* One of the Supported Operating Systems listed below on the Virtual Machine
* Add the following Firewall Rules to allow agent download, activation and management.

  Installing Virtual Machine - dsm.client-security.ctl.io 443/tcp
  
  Installing Virtual Machine - activate.dsm.client-security.ctl.io 443/tcp
  
  Installing Virtual Machine - relay.dsm.client-security.ctl.io 443/tcp

### Supported Managed Operating Systems
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (64-bit only)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (64-bit only)
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 (64-bit only)
* Microsoft Windows Server 2012 (64-bit only)

5. An email notification is sent to the initiator of the Blueprint for both queuing and completion.

### Agent Billing & Deactivation

Once the IPS Agent is installed on a VM, it will incur an hourly charge until the uninstall blueprint is executed successfully.  If a VM is to be decommissioned, the agent MUST be deactivated to avoid on-going charges.
