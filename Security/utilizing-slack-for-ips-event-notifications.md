### Overview

Slack is a team collaboration tool that offers persistent chat rooms organized by topic and also has private groups and direct messaging capabilities. Slack is available as long as you want and can be utilized with an unlimited number of people.

Our Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) provides real-time event notifications that can be integrated with Slack messaging. Using the Slack integration for “Incoming WebHooks”, our IPS can be set up to send event details on the rule triggered, source and destination information to a Slack channel so it can be quickly reviewed by your team or archived for review at a later time.
