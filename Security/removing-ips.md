### Overview

The Platform CenturyLink IPS utilizes an Agent installed on your Virtual Machine (VM) that monitors the VM for suspicious activity. If suspicious activity is found, the Agent logs the activity, which it may block or stop, and reports the incident based on the IPS policy. There is a default policy associated with each VM that is automatically tuned based on the host operating system and installed applications.

This Blueprint is for the removal and deactivation of the IPS service on the VM.

### Prerequisites
* A CenturyLink Cloud Account
* IPS currently running on the VM

### Agent Billing & Deactivation

Once the IPS Agent is uninstalled via this blueprint, the hourly charge will cease.

**Note:** If a VM is to be decommissioned, the agent MUST be deactivated via this blueprint to avoid on-going charges.
