### General Guidance - Marketplace Provider Agreement

The [Marketplace Provider Agreement](https://www.ctl.io/legal/marketplace) (MPA) can be found at [www.ctl.io/legal/marketplace/](https://www.ctl.io/legal/marketplace/). Prior to any technical integration planning sessions or integration work can begin, the MPA must be agreed to via digital click thru within the CenturyLink Marketplace Provider Portal.

While the Marketplace team is available to discuss the MPA with potential providers to provide clarification on any aspects of the agreement, we will not accept red lines or amendments to the MPA. While the MPA does create a contractual relationship between the Provider & CenturyLink, our goal is to provide a single contract for all Providers. This enables us to reduce the friction in bringing your product(s) to market in the CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace as quickly as possible.
The Marketplace was built as a pre-approved commercialization contract vehicle, it is meant to provide low-friction on-boarding of providers and fast procurement time for sales and customers. The process of involving both the provider and CenturyLink legal teams to review, edit, approve, and execute red lines to the MPA adds friction to the process and breaks the scalability of the intended model.

Additionally, you'll find that the MPA is patterned and is **very** similar to the agreements associated with other popular cloud marketplaces where your product(s) may already be placed.

Should you have additional questions or concerns, please contact us at [Marketplace@ctl.io](mailto:marketplace@ctl.io).
