### General Guidance - Marketplace Provider Agreement 

The [Marketplace Provider Agreement](https://www.ctl.io/legal/marketplace) (MPA) can be found at [www.ctl.io/legal/marketplace/](https://www.ctl.io/legal/marketplace/). The MPA must be agreed to & we must receive sign-off prior to your product being published on The CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace. 

We ask providers to be aware of our limited ability to make edits to the MPA centric to their organization. While the MPA does create a contractual relationship between the Provider & CenturyLink, our goal is to provide a single contract for all Providers. This enables us to reduce the friction in bringing your product(s) to market in the CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace as quickly as possible.

Additionally, you'll find that the MPA is pattered and is **very** similar to the agreements associated with other popular cloud marketplaces where your product(s) may already be placed.

Should you have additional questions or concerns, please contact us at [Marketplace@ctl.io](mailto:marketplace@ctl.io).
