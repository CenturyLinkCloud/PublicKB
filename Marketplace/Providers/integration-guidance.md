### Overview

In general, The CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace integrates with two primary software models.

1. Traditional software that requires the provider software to be installed on the customer's infrastructure.
2. Software as a Service, or SaaS.

While there is no exact criteria for the software that is eligible to be integrated into the CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace, below is guidance on what scenarios we see most frequently. If your organizations software doesn't match all of the criteria, your software is still likely a match. Contact us at [Marketplace@centurylink.com](mailto:Marketplace@centurylink.com) to discuss further.
