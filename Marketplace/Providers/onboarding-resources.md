The CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace allows customers to purchase software from an extensive list of Software Providers that partner with CenturyLink. During the CenturyLink Marketplace Onboarding Program, there are a variety of tasks that not only need to be completed by the CenturyLink Marketplace team, but the provider as well. The Onboarding Program is meant to streamline the process of getting partner products into the Marketplace. This Knowledge Base Article provides critical information necessary for becoming a Marketplace Provider.

### Provider Portal

Once your account has been setup, you will be notified via email and provided the information needed to access the [Provider Portal]( http://provider-portal.ctl.io/). Providers will use the same credentials they setup while creating their CenturyLink Cloud account to log into the Provider Portal.

The Provider Portal provides you with multiple resources.

First, it is where you will setup your product. For more information on how to setup your product, please see the Getting Started Guide: Marketplace & Ecosystem Provider Portal which is outlined below. Next, once your product has been published, the Provider Portal contains reports that will:

  * Indicate how many times your software has been deployed
  * Report on any errors that occurred during successful or failed deployments
  * Billable Revenue
  * Provider Remuneration Value

There are training videos provided on the Provider Portal Dashboard. Training videos are also provided in the just-in-time (JIT) manner throughout the portal, depending on what page the user is on. If you need further assistance in understanding your reports, please contact your Ecosystem Representative.

Finally, it provides the approval process for the [Marketplace Provider Agreement(MPA)](https://www.ctl.io/legal/marketplace/). The MPA must be approved before your product can be published.

### Marketplace Provider Agreement (MPA)

The Marketplace Provider Agreement governs the Terms & Conditions of your products entry into the Marketplace. It can be found [here](https://www.ctl.io/legal/marketplace/). If you have questions about the agreement, please address them with the CenturyLink Marketplace Digital Team by contacting us at [Marketplace@ctl.io](mailto:marketplace@ctl.io).

### Getting Started Guide: Marketplace & Ecosystem Provider Portal

The [Marketplace Getting Started Guide](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/marketplace/providers/getting-started-guide-marketplace-ecosystem-provider-portal/) will serve as your primary guide for creating your product in the Provider Portal. We recommend using it in conjunction with the training videos provided within the Portal. Our goal for the CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace is to provide a superior user experience with respect to learning about your product. If you'd like additional support developing your content, we're here to help. Contact us at [Marketplace@ctl.io](mailto:marketplace@ctl.io).

We update the guide monthly with any updates that have been released. If for some reason, you feel as though the guide is missing information or if you have additional questions, please let us know at [Marketplace@ctl.io](mailto:marketplace@ctl.io).
