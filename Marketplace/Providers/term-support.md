The marketplace can support both terms and commits associated with sales lead transactions. We have the ability to ensure that a marketplace transaction for software does not end before your commit date. If you or your organization is involved in a marketplace transaction that has a term or commit associated with it, you need to tell the marketplace team so that they can add a term attribute to the subscription. The sales staff members that lead the marketplace transactions are responsible for informing the marketplace team that a commit is associated with a particular subscription. A term or commit cannot cannot be added to a disabled subscription.

Contact us [marketplace@ctl.io](mailto:marketplace@ctl.io) if you have any questions.
