The Marketplace can support both terms and commits associated with sales lead transactions. We have the ability to ensure that a Marketplace transaction for software does not end before the set commit date. If you or your organization is involved in a Marketplace transaction that has a term or commit associated with it, you need to tell the Marketplace team so that they can add a term attribute to the subscription. Under the pricing tab of the product on the Marketplace, the term commit must be clearly stated to the prospective customer.
A term or commit cannot cannot be added to a disabled subscription nor altered for customers who purchased prior to a term commit being added to a product of service.

Contact us [Marketplace@centurylink.com](mailto:Marketplace@centurylink.com) if you have any questions.
