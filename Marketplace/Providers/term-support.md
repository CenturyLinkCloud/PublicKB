The Marketplace can support both terms and commits associated with sales lead transactions. We have the ability to ensure that a Marketplace transaction for software does not end before your commit date. If you or your organization is involved in a Marketplace transaction that has a term or commit associated with it, you need to tell the Marketplace team so that they can add a term attribute to the subscription. The sales staff members that lead the marketplace transactions are responsible for informing the Marketplace team that a commit is associated with a particular subscription. A term or commit cannot cannot be added to a disabled subscription nor altered for customers who purchased prior to a term commit being added to a product of service.

Contact us [marketplace@ctl.io](mailto:marketplace@ctl.io) if you have any questions.
