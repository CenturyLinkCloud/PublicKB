 ### Usage Based Billing

 Many providers require a usage based element to their subscription model. The CenturyLink Cloud Marketplace does support **Usage Based Billing** via our [SaaS API](software-as-a-service-saas-api.md).

 For more information, please contact us at [Marketplace@centurylink.com](mailto: Marketplace@centurylink.com).
