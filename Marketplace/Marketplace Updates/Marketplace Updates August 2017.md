### CenturyLink Marketplace Featured Provider

Our Featured Marketplace Provider is FixStream. FixStream is a disruptive AIOps (Algorithmic IT Operations) platform to help you proactively manage, plan, and trouble-shoot in real-time business critical processes in your hybrid IT environment.
Traditional tools provide domain-centric views without correlating events, thus impacting the visibility and the management of a hybrid cloud environment, costing companies hundreds of thousands of dollars during service outages alone.
FixStream instead provides a business-centric view of business transactions correlated to application services and infrastructure entities that allows enterprises to save $100,000s.
