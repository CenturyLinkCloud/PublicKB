The [Lumen Marketplace](https://www.ctl.io/marketplace-home/) provides self-service, on-demand provisioning of provider services on the Lumen Platform. Below are the latest additions to the Marketplace.
The Marketplace is constantly evolving with more products, providers, and solutions. Check the Marketplace Updates for the latest Marketplace offerings. If you would like to join the Lumen Marketplace Provider Program, you can learn more [here](https://www.ctl.io/marketplace-program/).

### Products added to the Lumen Marketplace November 2017 include:

* [Absio Corporation](https://www.ctl.io/marketplace/partner/MZZJ/) - Absio’s software-defined, Serverless Encryption™ technology is an easy-to-implement, cross-platform encryption solution that protects any form of data throughout its life cycle—from creation to deletion, everywhere it exists—without requiring organizations to manage keys or certificates, add hardware, or rely on a third-party service. Developers implement Absio technology through multi-language software development kits. No cryptography experience is necessary. A simple API enables developers to integrate powerful data security features into new and legacy desktop, mobile, IoT, cloud-native, server, client-side web applications and more with just a few lines of code.
