The [CenturyLink Marketplace](https://www.ctl.io/marketplace-home/) provides self-service, on-demand provisioning of provider services on the CenturyLink Platform. Below are the latest additions to the Marketplace.
The Marketplace is constantly evolving with more products, providers, and solutions. Check the Marketplace Updates for the latest Marketplace offerings. If you would like to join the CenturyLink Marketplace Provider Program, you can learn more [here](https://www.ctl.io/marketplace-program/).

### Products added to the CenturyLink Marketplace May 2018 include:

* [Citrix Cloud Workspaces - Secured Application Delivery and Management Managed by CenturyLink](https://www.ctl.io/marketplace/partner/VRT1/product/Citrix%20Cloud%20Workspaces/) This offer allows for fast delivery of the Citrix VDI suite of products through Citrix Cloud and CenturyLink Managed Services. Citrix Cloud is a platform that hosts and administers Citrix VDI services. It connects to your resources through the Citrix Cloud Connector on any cloud or infrastructure you choose (on-premises, public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud). It allows you to create, manage, and deploy workspaces with apps and data to your end-users from a single console. Key attributes of CenturyLink Managed Services and Citrix Cloud solution include:

* Fast: Deploy apps and desktops, or complete secure digital workspaces in hours, not weeks.
* Adaptable: Choose to deploy on any cloud or virtual infrastructure â€” or a hybrid of both.
* Secure: Keep all proprietary information for your apps, desktops and data under your control.
* Supportive: CenturyLink Managed Services is able to both onboard and assist in ongoing support of your Citrix Deployment.
* Simple: Implement a fully-integrated Citrix portfolio via a single-management plane to simplify administration.


### CenturyLink Marketplace Featured Provider

Our Featured Marketplace Provider is FixStream. FixStream is a disruptive AIOps (Algorithmic IT Operations) platform to help you proactively manage, plan, and trouble-shoot in real-time business critical processes in your hybrid IT environment.
Traditional tools provide domain-centric views without correlating events, thus impacting the visibility and the management of a hybrid cloud environment, costing companies hundreds of thousands of dollars during service outages alone.
FixStream instead provides a business-centric view of business transactions correlated to application services and infrastructure entities that allows enterprises to save $100,000s.
