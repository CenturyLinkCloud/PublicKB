Strategic partnerships have always played a role in CenturyLink’s ability to provide customers with robust solution options. As technology shifts and advances, CenturyLink’s Partnership Program is evolving to stay current with both our customers’ and partners’ digital transformations.
To that effort, the [CenturyLink Marketplace Provider Program](https://www.ctl.io/marketplace-program/) will be replacing the CenturyLink Ecosystem Partnership Program. The CenturyLink Marketplace Provider Program provides our strategic partners a comprehensive yet simplified digital route to market for products and services that deliver added value to CenturyLink technologies.
The CenturyLink Hybrid IT Marketplace makes Partner solutions available to some of the largest enterprise clients and leading-edge development teams in every conceivable industry, accessed from data centers around the world. CenturyLink customers have access to browse and make purchases via the CenturyLink Hybrid IT Marketplace with just a few clicks; while enjoying consolidated billing of their CenturyLink Cloud products and Marketplace purchases. The CenturyLink Hybrid IT Marketplace allows for SaaS-based Partner integrations, making it easier and more cost effective for businesses of all sizes to explore and purchase on-demand, online software. One of the major appeals of SaaS options is that they generally have a low barrier to entry, since they do not require hardware infrastructure to be set up, software to be installed and configured, or ongoing updates to be tested and deployed, allowing for very cost effective deployments and a subscription-based billing model.
Businesses of all types are demanding easier, flexible, and economical ways to execute their day to day business activities; the CenturyLink Hybrid IT Marketplace empowers the customer to do just that.
