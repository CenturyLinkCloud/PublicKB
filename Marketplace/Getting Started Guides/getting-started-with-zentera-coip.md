Zentera's CoIP solution directly addresses the security and networking needs of the multi-cloud market. CoIP's security capabilities are deeply integrated with its virtual overlay network, accelerating productivity, and business agility. CoIP works with any transport in any environment, does not interfere with existing infrastructure, and can be up and running in less than a day. The company is a Red Herring Top 100 winner and Info Security PG Magazine 2017 Top Startup of the Year based in Silicon Valley, and offers CoIP through select partners.

* Multi-cloud Security

* Multi-cloud Networking

* Cloud Migration

### Description

CoIP connects dispersed endpoints instantly and securely across multi-cloud environments as if they were in one unified private network. It protects by allowing enterprises to keep their security, physical networks, and compliance intact during deployments. CoIP shields production workloads and cloud endpoints through network encryption, east-west micro-segmentation, application interlock and white listing. CoIP can be integrated with existing network management platforms and security engines as well.

### Solution Overview

The CoIP platform runs on a network appliance, available either as a virtual appliance. The CoIP platform includes the zCenter™, zLink™, zChamber™, CoIP LAN™ and CoIP WAN™ software components.

The Zentera CoIP platform offers the following benefits:

* Enterprise-controlled virtual network across cloud ecosystems

* High-performance overlay virtual network

* Extremely fast implementation within days/weeks not months/year

**zCenter** - The web management portal for Zentera's CoIP platform

**zLink** - Zentera software controller that runs on CoIP endpoints

**zChamber** - Software-based cloud firewall system that automatically provisions secure chambers in multi-tenant cloud environments and enterprise datacenters

**CoIP LAN and WAN** - CoIP supports dynamically provisioned virtual LAN and WAN using private routing with any public or private IP addresses and using the underlying data center networks as the high-speed forwarding fabric with optional transport encryptions

### Offer

The Zentera CoIP solution is available for CenturyLink Cloud users as a virtual appliance. To receive a 60-day CoIP trial license, please contact Zentera Systems using the following link: [http://www.zentera.net/try-it-now](http://www.zentera.net/try-it-now)

### Post-Installation Note

If you want to access your CoIP web management portal, zCenter, from a computer that is outside of the CenturyLink Cloud network, you need to [add a public IP](../../Network/how-to-add-public-ip-to-virtual-machine.md) to your server through the CenturyLink Control Portal.
