### Summary

Alert Logic Web Security Manager Premium is a cloud-based managed solution that allows you to secure your web applications. Our managed web application firewall (WAF) is delivered in a Security-as-a-Service model which guards against emerging threats such as the OWASP Top 10, and provides immediate PCI DSS 6.6 compliance, providing you the web application security that you need.

### Description

Alert Logic Web Security Manager Premier includes both an Out-of-Band web application firewall (WAF) that monitors your web traffic and logs web violations, and an Inline WAF that actively blocks attacks.

As part of the Alert Logic Cloud Defender solution, Web Security Manager Premier ensures attacks are detected and mitigated. This diagram illustrates how it fits in with the rest of Cloud Defender components.
