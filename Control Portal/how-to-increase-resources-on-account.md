<h3>Description&nbsp;</h3>
<p>CenturyLink Cloud accounts start with a pre-defined resource (CPU/memory/storage) limit per data center. As customers grow their cloud usage, it's common to request an increase in resource limits. Other items to note about increasing resources:

<ul>
<li>Note that only paying customers will have their resource limits increased unless executive approval is given.</li>
<li>A single request can be made to Customer Care without additional CenturyLink authorization if it doesn't exceed 50% of current resource limit</li>
<li>After the first resource limit increase in a given 30 day period, each subsequent increase request will be subject to an internal review prior to approval</li>
</p>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;Detailed Steps</h3>
<p>1. You get an error in the upper right hand corner of Control indicating lack of resources (CPU, Memory, Storage) when you are building a new machine.</p>

<p>2. Please contact support via email: <a href="mailto:help@ctl.io">help@ctl.io</a></p>
<p>3. Please let them know that you have reached your resource limitations.</p>
<p>4. The engineer will validate your identity and then increase your limit.</p>
<p><strong>Once the Engineer has increased the resources on your account, you will need to take these steps in order to apply them to the correct data-center.&nbsp;</strong>
