### Getting Started with White Labeling
Lumen Cloud includes several features that allow organizations to replace specific Lumen branding elements with their own brand. This article covers the most popular elements of white-labeling, including:

* Site Name
* Header Bar Color Scheme
* Logos
* Site Footer

**NOTE**: Not all changes appear immediately. New site branding, logos, and other personalized elements may take up to 30 minutes to appear throughout the site. In addition, some changes appear only after the user has logged in and logged out a few times.

1. From the Navigation Menu, click **Settings > Account Settings**.

2. Make sure the **Settings** tab is active.

3. Click **Branding**.

### Using Custom Domains
A custom subdomain is automatically available for each account alias, in the format of `https://alias.cloudportal.io`. A customized 'Sign In Page' logo, if specified, appears on this URL. Nothing is required for the custom domain to be available. It should just be promoted as the flagship login page where appropriate.
