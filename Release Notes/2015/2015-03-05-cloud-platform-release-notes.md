### New Features (1)

* **Service Catalog.** Selected platform services can now be selectively exposed to chosen subaccounts (as well as child subaccounts). This new capability is ideal for the phased rollout of new features to certain subaccounts. The service catalog currently includes: load balancers, premium backup, and public IP addresses for servers.

### Minor Enhancements (6)

* **New Domains.** Effective March 5, the default CenturyLink Cloud domain will be updated to control.ctl.io.  The URL for SAML users has also been updated to https://[`account-alias`].cloudportal.io (where `account-alias` is your four-letter account identifier). The legacy domains will continue to operate for 90 days.

* **Subdomains featuring Account Alias.** Along with the new domains listed above, custom subdomains based on account alias are now available, in the form of https://[`account-alias`].cloudportal.io. Use the Site Branding capabilities (under the Account tab) to update the logo that appears on the bottom of the page. This furthers the "white label" capabilities of the platform.

* **Support for Custom Price Lists & Displays.** Administrators who want to show a custom price for services in the Control Portal can now do so. Contact CenturyLink Cloud to learn more.

* **Cloud Network Services in DE1.** CenturyLink Cloud deployments in DE1 can now be connected to other environments using Cloud Network Services.  This capability delivers private, secure, and high-speed connectivity between traditional and cloud environments.

* **MS SQL Server 2014.** Deploy MS SQL 2014 Web, Standard & Enterprise Editions on CenturyLink Cloud via Blueprints.  These SQL instances are unmanaged; licensing is handled under CenturyLink's SPLA relationship with Microsoft.

* **New Left Navigation Control.** Two new icons appear in the left-hand side of the Control Portal interface: the **+** icon presents a new path for the creation of servers and groups; clicking the **infrastructure** icon exposes the familiar 'tree view' for the management of existing resources.

### Online Tools (3)

* **Map of CenturyLink data centers and services.** View CenturyLink's portfolio of capabilities by data center using an [interactive map](http://www.ctl.io/data-centers/) online.  The tool supports multiple layers of filtering, as well as standard online map controls.
