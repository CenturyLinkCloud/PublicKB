### New Features (5)

* __Bare Metal servers.__ Get the isolation and performance you need by building and managing physical machines in the CenturyLink Platform.

As you choose the machine size (up to 20 cores and 128 GB of memory) and Operating System (options include: CentOS 6, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Windows Server 2012 R2), the Control Portal gives you a cost estimate.

### Open Source Contributions (5)

* [__Ansible Adapter for CenturyLink Cloud.__](//github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/clc-ansible-module) The CenturyLink Cloud Ansible Modules allow devops to utilize the popular provisioning tool Ansible to define and manage infrastructure resources on the CenturyLink Cloud platform. Among other capabilities, the adapter lets you pull server inventory, create policies, create and manage groups, create and manage servers, execute scripts packages against servers, and much more.

* [__Java (Spring-Data) adapter for Orchestrate.__](//github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/clc-adapter-orchestrate) The Orchestrate Adapter implements the standard Spring-Data interfaces so that using the Orchestrate adapter is exactly like using any other Spring-Data adapter.  This also allows for an easy change from the backend your project might be using now, like Mongo, to use Orchestrate by simply updating your Spring configuration. The Adapter provides the basic find, find-all, and other out of the box queries you would expect to have.  The adapter also supports the ability to define your own custom queries as needed.  We also added some additional features that can be utilized via annotations in your service implementations.  One of the most popular features we added was the ability to encrypt/decrypt data at the attribute level by simply applying the @Encrypted annotation to the variable declaration.

* [__Lorry.io__](//lorry.io/). UI improvements for ease-of-use; added compatibility for new Docker-compose 1.3 features: container affinities and constraints; added support for hash and sequence values for environment key. See wiki notes [here](//github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/lorry-ui).

* [__ImageLayers.io__](//imagelayers.io/). UI fixes; added ability to browse Docker Hub from image leaf node. Review wiki notes [here](//github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/imagelayers-graph).

* [__Panamax.io__](//panamax.io/) Deeper integration with ImageLayers.io and Lorry.io; added docker-compose.yml support: conversion API,
export PMX file as Compose YAML, copy-to-clipboard and preview functionality. Check out the release notes for the [Panamax UI v2.20](//github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/panamax-ui/) and [Panamax API v0.3.3](//github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/panamax-api/) updates.

### Bug Fixes (4)

* __Operations that release IP address will get null reference exception.__ We've fixed a bug where some users would get an error when releasing a public IP.

* __Server details - Hyperscale - action dropdown - add public ip missing.__ Hyperscale users can now see the menu item to add public IPs to a server.

* __Roles - DNS - DNS Manager is unable to add a new DNS zone - "You do not have Blueprints/Blueprint:Deploy permission to this resource".__ The DNS Manager role can now create zones without error.

* __Monitoring metrics appear stale and autoscale events are not triggered.__ The platform was updated to improve the reliability of metric collection and customers should see improved reliability of the alerting and autoscale services!
