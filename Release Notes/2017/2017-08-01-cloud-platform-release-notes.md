***Managed Services***

For CenturyLink Managed Services customers, we have enhanced our graphing and metrics reporting capabilities along with our AWS CloudWatch Monitoring capabilities in our recently launched monitoring portal.

In addition to customers being able to graph CPU and Memory, Disk metrics for Network has been included for comprehensive visibility into their infrastructure across all supported Operating Systems. Moreover, customers are now able to overlay any individually collected metric attributes to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of the behavior of their applications.

We also have enhanced our capabilities to natively monitor and alert on AWS services such as RDS, EC2, and ELB via CloudWatch, eliminating the requirement for an agent on the target device. If you would like to take advantage of our AWS CloudWatch monitoring functionality and Managed Services capabilities, please reach out to us via the ‘support center’ option inside the Cloud Application Manager.
