### New Features (1)
* __Simple Backup Anywhere__

  __Simple Backup now available anywhere!__

  Simple Backup is now available anywhere! Simple Backup Anywhere extends Simple Backup outside of CenturyLink Cloud. This allows customers to backup and protect their workloads virtually anywhere outbound internet connectivity is available. You can now use Simple Backup on CenturyLink's traditional hosting platforms (DCC, Intelligent Hosting, Colo) as well as in other cloud provider environments. Please see our Knowledge Base article (https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/backup/backup-anywhere/) for more information about Simple Backup Anywhere.

  __Costing Monthly Dashboard__

  Building on top of our recently released [costing dashboard](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/release-notes/2017/2017-09-26-cloud-platform-release-notes/), Cloud Application Manager customers with Optimized AWS providers now have access to a Monthly Report that provides a granular breakdown of cost by day and by service in order to further understand how an environment is performing financially.  Customers can access this new functionality as part of the Analytics site of Cloud Application manager by selecting ‘Cost’ and then ‘Monthly Reports’ from the left-hand navigation bar.

  __New Feature to Add Volume Disks to DCC-Foundation__

  Cloud Application Manager customers using a DCC-Foundation provider now have the ability to add storage disks to the deployment policies to include additional volumes to their DCC-Foundation deployments.
