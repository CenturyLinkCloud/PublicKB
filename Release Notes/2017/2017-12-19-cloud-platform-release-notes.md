### New Features (3)

##### Cloud Application Manager

###### Monitoring

__Graphing of Anomaly Detection and Forecasting__

This new feature set now allows for graphing of anomaly detection and forecasting in Cloud Application Manager Monitoring.  This relates to the previously released monitoring checks that utilize metric forecasting based on triple exponentially smoothed (Holt Winters) of datasets to provide anomaly detection.  This toolset provides visualization and insight for users to better understand how anomaly detection can be applied to their datasets to achieve a higher order level of event detection with Cloud Application Manager Monitoring. Helper utilities also provided to assist users in defining forecast based anomaly detection checks and their parameters.

Product Highlights include the following "functions" that can be applied to any dataset:

*	**Forecast** – Graphs based on projected future states of metric data.  Future time periods can be specified for any metric (including those originating from AWS CloudWatch.  This allows to visualize the calculation of forecasts.

*	**Confidence** – A tool to calibrate the uncertainty in a forecasted dataset.  This allows for the visualization of anomalies as a signal crosses over a confidence interval.

*	**Anomaly** – Visual representation of the degree of aberration within a signal.


__AWS Dashboards is now Live!__

Cloud Application Manager customers can now see their AWS CloudWatch metrics on the new dashboard landing page.  Information about their AWS infrastructure and services can be viewed in an easy to read dashboard.
