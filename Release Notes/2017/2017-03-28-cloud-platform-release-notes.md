### Enhancements (5)

* __Cloud Application Manager__

  * Deployment Policy and Script boxes support for Microsoft Azure Provider

    Currently, the Microsoft Azure ARM provider allows users to deploy infrastructure and cloud native services using Microsoft Azure templates. With this enhancement, users can create Deployment Policies and run Script boxes on infrastructure provisioned using Microsoft Azure Provider. The new feature lets you deploy virtual machines (VMs) using the deployment policy boxes.

    In order for you to leverage the new feature, you have to synchronize the Azure ARM provider. After the synchronization is complete, the Configuration tab will list all the operating systems that can be deployed.

  * Workspace Dashboard View

    A new Dashboard view was added that provides real-time information about the workspace, such as instances deployed, boxes, providers and team members that are collaborating.

    In addition, you can monitor provider usage and lifecycle events, and make a search based on the date of the events.


  * Renaming of Microsoft Azure Provider

    As you are aware, Cloud Application Manager supports both Azure Classic and Microsoft Azure as providers. Starting ​3/28/2017​, you will see a change in how they are identified within Cloud Application Manager. We are making this change to be consistent with the language Microsoft uses to communicate with their customers


  * Dependency on CenturyLink Cloud for Microsoft Azure Customers

    For users who are interested in signing up a new Microsoft Azure account as part of the CenturyLink Reseller Program, starting ​3/28/2017​, you are no longer required to key-in your CenturyLink Cloud credentials. That requirement has been removed. At the same time, going forward only ​Organization Administrators​ will have the ability to sign up for a new Microsoft Azure account from CenturyLink. If you are an Organization Administrator, you will continue to see an option to sign up for a new Microsoft Azure Account when you create a new ​Microsoft Azure​ provider.


  * Usage-based billing

    With the launch of Cloud Application Manager https://news.centurylink.com/news/centurylink-advances-multi-cloud-management-strategy-with-launch-of-cloud-application-manager​ we are also making changes to our billing model for the Application Lifecycle Management module (former ElasticBox core features). As communicated earlier, with the retirement of Developer edition, all customers get the “​enterprise edition​” features but have an option to buy either the Cloud edition (hosted version) or the Datacenter edition (appliance version). For the Cloud edition, we are moving from ​a per-user based​ model to​ a per-instance based​ model. For the Datacenter edition, we are moving from the ​per-user based model to ​a fixed cost​ model. Cloud Application Manager customers who have signed up after 2/28/2017, as communicated and published at www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/#Pricing​ and the change takes effect starting ​3/30/2017​.


  * Self-service ticketing Portal

    Starting ​3/30/2017​ you will have access to a self-service ticketing portal to open/view tickets with CenturyLink support. The new ticketing portal is our interface for managing tickets, alerts and changes for Cloud Application Manager, Managed Hosting and Dedicated Cloud customers. Your Cloud Application Manager credentials will allow you to single sign-on to the ticketing portal. You can also directly access the ticketing portal at https://managedservices.ctl.io/msp/oauth/login​ which will redirect you to provide your Cloud Application Manager credentials. Once authenticated, you will be logged-in to the ticketing portal. As always you can reach out to CenturyLink Support via phone and email as published here https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/support/
