### New Features (1)
* __Cloud Application Manager (CAM)__

  __Monitoring Enhancements__

  Cloud Application Manager's monitoring service, Watcher, has been integrated with CenturyLink's Analytics service.  The integration of Watcher with Analytics provides customers the added capabilities of advanced alerting based on analytic predictive models providing event correlation against arbitrary time series streams.

  __Cloud Optimization and Analytics__

  Cloud Application Manager customers who utilize Microsoft Azure through CenturyLink for Consolidated Billing and Platform Support now may generate multiple [Azure subscriptions](../../Cloud Application Manager/Cloud Optimization/partner-cloud-integration-azure-new.md). Multiple Azure subscriptions provides your administrators the ability to easily manage users and resources for multiple Azure projects and departments by placing them in different Azure "accounts."

IIS is an extensible web server created by Microsoft for use with the Windows family of OSes.  By selecting to deploy a Managed IIS server to AWS or Microsoft Azure - (CenturyLink Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation) - customers get all the features of a managed server along with management of the IIS Server instance.  Simply Delegate Management to CenturyLink and receive Monitoring, Alerting, Ticketing, Remote Administration and Patching for both the VM and the IIS Server instance.
