### New Features (1)

* __Orchestrate.io - Randomized Sorting.__ Now, equally scored results can show up in different orders. By adding `sort=_random` to the URL query string, the search results will now have an equal chance at being displayed first. Users can choose to randomize sort within an existing search query, i.e. randomize the results of searching for "last name Twain, first name Mark" `sort=value.last_name,value.first_name,_random`. Also, users have the option to randomize results with a predictable seed (by setting `sort=_random:somevalue`), and any subsequent calls to the same seed will result in the same random ordering.

### Early Adopter Program Updates (4)

* __Runner Beta.__ Several new capabilities are available for the agent-less automation service:

  * **Job Execution Expiration time** - Added ability for users to set an expiration time for a job. This helps users to stop any unexpected long-running executions and look at the detailed status logs to know which task was running, and for how long. Refer our latest documentation for Job Service available to beta users [Create Job - Password Protected](http://info.runner.ctl.io/job-service/#createJob) and [Update Job - Password Protected](http://info.runner.ctl.io/job-service/#updateJob) for details. The execution will move to a new state `EXPIRED` after it reaches the specified time.
  * **New default status of job execution** - When a job is executed, the default state will be `INITIALIZING` (previously, the default state was `PENDING`), since the various tasks in your playbook are being processed before they are actually executed. Further, you can stop and kill job executions that are in `PENDING` state.

### Enhancements (1)

* __Private routing of traffic between servers using public IPs provided by CenturyLink Cloud.__ Traffic between servers using public IPs provided by CenturyLink Cloud are now routed over our private MPLS network between CenturyLink Cloud Data Centers. This approach offers increased performance and reliability compared to using the public Internet.

### Announcements (1)
