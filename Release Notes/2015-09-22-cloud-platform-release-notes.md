* __[Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/centurylink)__ Over the past few months, we’ve been working on integration between the Bitnami “stacks” library of open source software and our Blueprint orchestration.  This release we are excited to announce full integration [between the two libraries](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/search/?q=bitnami+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.ctl.io%2Fknowledge-base%2F), bringing the full power of Bitnami’s software automation to CenturyLink customers.
