### Announcements (3)

#### Application Lifecycle Management

##### Google Cloud Engine support updates 

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) has made a major update of the Google Cloud Engine support. It now adds support for:
* Discovery of existing compute instances already deployed into Google Cloud provider type.
* Registration of discovered instances into Cloud Application Manager.
* Supports the native terminate protection feature and synchronizes its status whenever it is configured in Cloud Application Manager or when an instance is registered.
* Enablement of this type of providers to use self-register. A command snippet will be provided to let users add it to any compute bootstrapping process to perform the self-registering of the instance when deployed from outside of Cloud Application Manager.

All the above features will be available in your existing Google Cloud providers, once you synchronize them.

##### New CloudFormation types supported

Application Lifecycle Management now supports additional CloudFormation types to be used in CloudFormation template boxes. These additional types are: "AWS::QLDB::Ledger" and "AWS::Glue::Workflow". Users can now use these new resource types in the template definition of any CloudFormation template box or update any existing template instance to use it.
