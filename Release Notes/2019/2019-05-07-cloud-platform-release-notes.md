When an instance is in "Processing" state and it is executing an event script, a new option "Abort" will appear under the three dots button in the instance details page to allow the user to abort the event script being executed and leave the instance in an unavailable state. This allows the user to recover the control of an instance stuck in a script execution not returning the control to Cloud Application Manager and fix the issue before retrying to run the event script.

2. **Execute**: box will be made public as execute-only, so it will only be deployable and only public variables will be visible.
3. **Closed**: box will be used to embed into other boxes as box variables, but event code will be hidden. Only public variables will be visible.
