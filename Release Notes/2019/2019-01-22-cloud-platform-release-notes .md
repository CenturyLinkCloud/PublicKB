### Enhancements (4)

#### [Cloud Application Manager](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/)

##### Replay Welcome Tour

Cloud Application Manager (CAM) users now have the ability to replay the welcome tour that was only available when accessing the application for the first time. The option to replay the welcome tour is available in the user menu when accessing through the Management or Applications sites.  Users can select the dropdown next to the user name and select the "Play Welcome Tour" option to replay the welcome tour.

##### WebPack Technology for Loading Static Resources

Cloud Application Manager now implements a new way of loading static resources through WebPack. With this new technology, users can take advantage of the improved performance of the product and faster loading times.

#### [Analytics](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/cloud-optimization/)

##### Analytics Available for Any Type of AWS or Azure Provider

For Azure, CenturyLink now extends our Analytics offering to unmanaged providers that are sourced by the customer. This functionality is in addition to the same recently-announced functionality for AWS providers. On these "Bring Your Own Cloud" Providers, administrators will see an "Analytics" option, capable of activating Cloud Optimization & Analytics capabilities before or after a Provider has been launched. Once Cloud Optimization & Analytics is activated for a customer-sourced Provider, CenturyLink will begin including that Provider's charges in the monthly basis for Platform Advisory Support. All CAM administrators have access to pricing details in the Management Site of CAM.

#### [Application Lifecycle Management](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/application-lifecycle-management/)

##### New CloudFormation Types Supported

Application Lifecycle Management now supports additional CloudFormation types to be used in CloudFormation template boxes. These additional types are:
"AWS::Route53Resolver::ResolverRuleAssociation", "AWS::DocDB::DBCluster", "AWS::DocDB::DBClusterParameterGroup", "AWS::DocDB::DBInstance" and
"AWS::DocDB::DBSubnetGroup". The user can now use these new resource types in the template definition of any CloudFormation template box or update the template file of any existing template instance and reconfigure it to use the new resource types.

### Bug Fixes (1)

#### Windows 2016 Patch for CenturyLink Cloud
