#### [Cloud Application Manager Platform](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/)

##### CenturyLink Cloud sub-accounts support

Cloud Application Manager now supports CenturyLink Cloud (CLC) sub-accounts. Users will now be able to see sub-accounts of the configured account, under a separate tab within the Provider details. From there, users can register the first level of sub-accounts as new providers in Cloud Application manager, either individually by clicking on the register icon on each line or in bulk by selecting multiple sub-accounts and registering in bulk. With this change, users also have an option to specify the account alias when creating a new CLC provider.

#### [Application Lifecycle Management](https://www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/application-lifecycle-management/)

##### Added support for manual registration in vCloud based provider types

Cloud Application Manager has added the feature to manually register vCloud or CenturyLink Private Cloud on vCloud Foundation compute instances. There is now a toggle when registering an instance to make it automatic, that allows Cloud Application Manager to take careÂ of all the registration process, although this requires a restart of the machine, or to make it manual, that will show a command snippet for the user to manually execute inside the machine for it to be registered without requiring restart.
