### Enhancements (2)

### Announcements (3)
* __Standard and Premium Block Storage Price Reduction__. Effective April 1, 2016, list pricing for Standard and Premium have been reduced. Both services are now priced at $0.12 GB per month.
* __Reminder: Standard and Premium Backup Features Retire__. Effective May 1, 2016, Standard and Premium backup features will reach end of life in Centurylink Cloud in all locations. 
  Late last year, CenturyLink notified customers that the backup features associated with “Standard” and “Premium” storage were to be retired in early 2016. As a result of this platform change, customers will no longer have access to their backup data from Standard and Premium storage features after April 30, 2016. Data from Standard and Premium backups are not carried over or otherwise migrated to the Simple Backup Service, or any other backup product. Customers requiring access to this data should request backup restores as soon as possible via ticket at help@ctl.io. There is no impact to the persistent storage attached to servers, but your data will no longer be automatically backed up unless you take action.
* __Intrusion Prevention/IPS Price Reduction__. CenturyLink is constantly reviewing the market to remain competitive with our features and pricing. Based on current research, we have lowered the price for our Intrusion Prevention/IPS product to $0.07 per VM per hour. For approximately only $50 a month per server, add an extra layer of security to your servers and help eliminate one avenue for hackers to take down your servers. If you would like to try IPS for 30 days for free, please sign up at our product page [Intrusion Prevention Service](https://www.ctl.io/intrusion-prevention-service/)
