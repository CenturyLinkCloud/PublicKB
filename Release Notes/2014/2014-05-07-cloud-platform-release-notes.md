  <li><strong>Disallow VM snapshots for servers with more than 1TB of storage.&nbsp;</strong>New limit introduced to avoid performance degradation that occurs when taking snapshots of large VMs.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster activity completion due to increased size of Blueprint processing queue</strong>. Continued improvements in the platform led to increase in parallelization of activities, resulting in less waiting for provisioning, server power operations,
    and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Option no-charge bandwidth for site-to-site VPN between hardware in same data center.&nbsp;</strong>For customers connecting the CenturyLink Cloud to co-located hardware in the same data center, you can now have a site to site VPN configuration
