### New Features (1)
* __Runner:__ Our [automated infrastructure management service](https://www.ctl.io/runner/) has added the following new features:
	- Added support for Ansible wait_for module.
	- Set default fork count to 5 to align with Ansible conventions.  Users can still specify a value greater than 5.
	- Runner Job API now supports the passing of Ansible options (i.e. list-tasks, list-hosts, etc.).  
	- Additional level of control regarding public products.  Public products are now white-listed.  Users are no longer able to simply make a product public by setting the visibility to 'public'.
	- Added basic search by name capability on the jobs view page in the Runner UI. (image is for this bullet)
