### Enhancements (1)
* __CenturyLink Cloud Platform: Additional Inventory Protection__

	The CenturyLink Cloud Platform has augmented our protection algorithms that enforce resource limits on Virtual and Bare Metal Servers. This change will help prevent situations in which a single account utilizes more capacity than desired.


### Announcements (2)
* __Relational DB now available in Runner!__ - Users can now incorporate Relational DB into a Runner job to deploy a MySQL-compatible Relational DB instance to IL1, VA1, NY1, UC1, GB3, SG1 or CA3. Visit https://runner.ctl.io to view Relational DB in the marketplace and https://www.ctl.io/relational-database/ for additional product information.

* __Upcoming Enhancements to Authentication & Changes for Your SAML Configuration__ - In the coming months, CenturyLink Cloud will be upgrading its authentication service. Many customers will not experience any material changes as a result of this upgrade. However, customers that have enabled SAML for their CenturyLink Cloud accounts will be required to make configuration changes to ensure that authentication continues to function.  Please review this [FAQ](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/support/authentication-updates-faq/)  to understand the action required on your part, if any.<p>
