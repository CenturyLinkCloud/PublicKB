### Announcements (3)
* __Retirement Date for Standard & Premium Backup Features Extended to May 31, 2016__. Effective June 1, 2016, Standard and Premium backup features will reach end of life in CenturyLink Cloud in all locations. Late last year, CenturyLink notified customers that the backup features associated with “Standard” and “Premium” storage were to be retired in early 2016. As a result of this platform change, customers will no longer have access to their backup data from Standard and Premium storage features after May 31, 2016. Data from Standard and Premium backups are not carried over or otherwise migrated to the Simple Backup Service, or any other backup product. Customers requiring access to this data should request backup restores as soon as possible via ticket at help@ctl.io. There is no impact to the persistent storage attached to servers, but your data will no longer be automatically backed up unless you take action.

*  __API Documentation__. Relational DB API documentation is now available at https://www.ctl.io/api-docs/v2/#relational-database-rdbs.
