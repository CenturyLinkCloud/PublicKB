### Announcements (1)

* __Orchestrate - End of Life:__

Lumen has announced that it will be retiring the Orchestrate NoSQL Database service. We want to help make this transition as smooth as possible, so we are providing our customers a 120 day transition period. In the coming days, a best practices guide for migrating data will be sent to current Orchestrate users.

Effective March 17, 2017, the Orchestrate NoSQL Database service (“Orchestrate”) will be retired. On this date, existing free and paid accounts will be deactivated. Until then it will remain fully supported and customers will continue to have access to any applicable data in order to migrate and/or backup any applicable content prior to deactivation.

After March 17, customers will no longer have access to any data or content within the Orchestrate NoSQL Database service. For assistance with this transition, contact Lumen Cloud support by opening a ticket via help@ctl.io or reach out to your account manager.
