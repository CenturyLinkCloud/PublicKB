<ul>
  <li><strong>Hyperscale Anti-affinity Pools.</strong> Create and maintain anti-affinity groups for Hyperscale servers to ensure an even distribution of virtual machines across physical hardware. These policies are applied when servers are added to an existing
    anti-affinity pool.

  <li><strong>New CenturyLink Cloud Data Centers</strong>. The CenturyLink Cloud opened data centers in Santa Clara, CA and Sterling, VA. These new locations -- coming online in March 2014 -- offer all the standard CenturyLink Cloud capabilities and also
    support Hyperscale Servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Beta of Redesigned Groups, Server UI.&nbsp;</strong>All customers now have access to the public beta of the redesigned Groups and Server UI. This new interface makes it easier to perform popular activities and seamlessly navigate between
    the compute resources in an account. This release focuses on browsing Groups and servers and subsequent releases will include the ability to create and configure Groups and servers.

    sending alerts when policies are violated. Read more in the <a href="https://t3n.zendesk.com/entries/27202824-Cloud-Server-Alerting-FAQ">new FAQ about the alert service</a>.
