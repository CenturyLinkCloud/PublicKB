   >this post on the Iron Foundry blog</a> for more details.</li>
  <li><strong>Update Firewall Policy UI to simplify custom port range definition</strong>. Instead of having the user view two windows to define a custom port range for a firewall policy, we've simplified the UI to address standard and custom ports all in
    one window.</li>
  <li><strong>Friendly naming of data centers.</strong>&nbsp;In the Control Portal, users no longer see names like "WA1" and "GB1", but rather, see more informative names that identify the city and country of the data center.</li>
