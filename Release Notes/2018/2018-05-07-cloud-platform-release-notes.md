###### Cloud Optimization and Analytics

A new Usage History Enhancement details how CenturyLink safeguards customer accounts so they are billed fairly.  If a Reserved instance is purchased in one account and assigned by Amazon Web Services to a different account, CenturyLink will perform inter-customer adjustments. The RI-purchasing account will be credited and the RI-consuming account will be debited (see image below).
