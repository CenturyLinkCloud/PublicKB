#### [Load Balancer as a Service (LBaaS)](//www.ctl.io/load-balancing/)

CenturyLink Cloud has released a new load balancer service called Load Balancer as a Service (LBaaS) in our DE1, IL1 and NY1 locations. We've added more features that allow you to focus on your business while we help service your infrastructure. Along with all of the features available in the current Shared Load Balancer service, weâ€™ve added:

* TCP load balancing
* Load balance on any port 23 and up
* Configurable health checks

These new features are now available in our CA3, DE1, DE3, GB3, IL1, NY1, SG1, UC1 and VA1 locations, with plans to enable additional locations. Watch for future announcements regarding service expansion. Please note, our Shared Load Balancer service will continue to be available in all other locations until they are LBaaS enabled. 

For information on pricing for LBaaS and Shared Load Balancer, see [pricing](//www.ctl.io/pricing).
