##### Cloud Application Manager

###### Cloud Analytics


Cloud Application Manager has introduced a suite of Advanced Analytics capabilities in addition to our existing Savings, Best Practices, Security and Costing capabilities and are available immediately for all existing CenturyLink optimized AWS accounts so customers are able to better manage their cloud environments.    

The new Advanced Analytics capabilities provide users hundreds of additional prebuilt reports, including new categories Inventory and Utilization, with options to filter data even further for more detailed real-time and spot-in-time reporting.  Additionally, users are now able to save their custom filters, to save time, and export reports to better communicate internally and provide more reporting consistency.
