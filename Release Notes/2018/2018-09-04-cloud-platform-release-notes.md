### Enhancements (6)

#### [Cloud Application Manager](//www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/)

#### [Application Lifecycle Management](//www.ctl.io/cloud-application-manager/application-lifecycle-management/)

##### Support for Azure Scale Sets

Application Lifecycle Management now provides support to use Scale Set into a Microsoft Azure Deployment Policy box, so that the instances deployed with it would be included into a Scale Set Azure resource and enable the user to turn on the auto scaling feature by setting up the CPU thresholds and instance increments.

##### Support for Azure Load Balancers

Application Lifecycle Management now supports Azure Load Balancer and Azure App Gateway to be added to a Microsoft Azure Deployment Policy box. Once a user enables Scale Set on it, a new section appears allowing the user to enable load balancer, either by using Azure Load Balancer or by using an Azure App Gateway.

* Support for Linux Operating Systems : RHEL6/7, Ubuntu 14/16 for DR to Azure.
* CMS box in Cloud Application Manager catalogs to deploy and configure SafeHaven Console.
* Addition of Azure Statistics tab in SafeHaven Console.
* Support for Azure Managed Disks.
