### Enhancements (2)

#### [CenturyLink Cloud](https://www.ctl.io/centurylink-public-cloud/) Site to Site VPN

We have updated the IP address ranges used for Site to Site VPNâ€™s within CenturyLink Cloud. Any changes/edits to an existing Site to Site VPN will update the IP address automatically to one of the new IP addresses, which may require you to update the configuration on the other end of the VPN. A warning message will notify you during an edit that the IP address is changing. This change is being made to better protect our customers with DDoS mitigation on the new IP ranges.

#### [Managed Services Anywhere](https://www.ctl.io/managed-services-anywhere/)

Managed Services Anywhere now includes support for additional operating systems: RHEL 8 and Windows 2019. Customers deploying these Operating Systems on MSA enabled providers will now enjoy all the benefits of [Managed Services Anywhere](https://www.ctl.io/legal/cloud-application-manager/service-guide/) on those OSes.
