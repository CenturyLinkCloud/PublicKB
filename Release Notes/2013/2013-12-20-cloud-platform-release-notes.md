  </li>
  <li><strong>Account cleanup services for resellers.&nbsp;</strong>In order to reduce the impact of fraud and make it simpler to offer trial accounts, the CenturyLink Cloud added a new automated service that can delete all billed resources (e.g. servers,
    storage, networks, load balancers) from an account upon account closure.</li>
  <li><strong>Beta release of Cloud Foundry BOSH CPI</strong>. We've completed a beta version of the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/bosh/">BOSH </a>Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) that lets Cloud Foundry users build and
    manage their own PaaS on the CenturyLink Cloud. You can download the open source components from our <a href="https://github.com/Tier3/bosh">BOSH Github repository</a> and run a micro-BOSH deployment process from source code. See the
    <a
    href="https://github.com/Tier3/bosh/wiki/Getting-Started">Getting Started Guide</a> for more info.</li>
