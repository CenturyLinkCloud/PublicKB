Once the Dedicated Cloud Compute Node(s) and Instance(s) are deployed, the customer may supply their own application software and respective licenses to complete the solution meeting their business needs. CenturyLink does not provide any monitoring or management of customer-provided software or services with the base Dedicated Cloud Compute service; provided, however, customers may order an advanced monitoring feature by separately ordering CenturyLink Intelligent Monitoring or CenturyLink Managed Application Services, both of which have separate Service Guides and SLAs.

CenturyLink maintains all managed servers, including the repair and replacement of defective or failed hardware and the installation of hardware upgrades, as needed. CenturyLink may subcontract any hardware support to the manufacturer or equivalent vendor in order to expedite repairs. This is included with the Dedicated Cloud Compute Service.
