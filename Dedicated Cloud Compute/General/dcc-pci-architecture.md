Security and compliance are big issues in the world of data management and storage, especially as more and more governing agencies set up rules to protect the security of that data. The [Payment Card Industry (PCI)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) has set rules around customer data and the required physical, network, and process security measures for protecting it.

Dedicated Cloud Compute (DCC) has a recommended architecture plan for PCI compliance which ensures that many of the [standards for security](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library) are met. Below is a table that explains each requirement, along with a list of Lumen products that can contribute to meeting the standard for each requirement.
