Customers that choose to have the same Dedicated Cloud Compute Node type and CPUs and have more than one server within a failover group will be able to use Dynamic Instance Balancing.

This service feature allows Dedicated Cloud Compute Instances to move across identical Dedicated Cloud Compute Nodes without interruption to the operating system or applications based on Dedicated Cloud Compute Instance CPU requirements and available memory. This service feature allows customers to manage capacity issues by simply adding additional Dedicated Cloud Compute Nodes to a failover pool. Individual Dedicated Cloud Compute Instances will dynamically balance themselves across the available Dedicated Cloud Compute Nodes over time as load characteristics change.
