This demo shows some of the options for self-service VM migration to the Dedicated Cloud Compute (DCC) Foundation workspace using vCloud Availability.

**Note:** This video was taken from a demo of DCC Foundation done in the lab environment, pre-release. There may be subtle differences in the appearance of the workspace or you may hear references to other parts of the demo during the recording.
