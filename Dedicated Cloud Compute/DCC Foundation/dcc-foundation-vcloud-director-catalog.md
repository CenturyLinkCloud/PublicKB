This demo shows the Dedicated Cloud Compute (DCC) catalog in the vCloud Director workspace. The catalog contains templates and media that customers can use to maximize efficiency in their workspace.

**Note:** This video was taken from a demo of DCC Foundation done in the lab environment, pre-release. There may be subtle differences in the appearance of the workspace or you may hear references to other parts of the demo during the recording.
