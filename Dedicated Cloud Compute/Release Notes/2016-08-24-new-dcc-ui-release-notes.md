### New Features

* Create > Add Storage. Initial release that allows a storage configuration to be priced **but not yet ordered**.

### Limitations

* Create > Add Storage. Only clusters with Utility Storage will provide a price estimate.

### Enhancements

* Host and Server pages. Comma separated values now display as bulleted lists.
* Compute and Storage tabs. Improved differentiation between expand icon and "Running" status icon.
* Compute tab. Moved icon for Operating System to left of status icon.
