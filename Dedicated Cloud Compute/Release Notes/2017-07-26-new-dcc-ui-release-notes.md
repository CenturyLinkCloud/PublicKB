### Enhancements

* Global Navigation: More improvements switching between other CenturyLink services
* Order Expiration: Saved orders that have not been updated for 8 days will automatically expire and release the resources that were reserved. Saved orders shown as expiring soon should be updated or deployed to prevent them having to be recreated after they expire
* Price Changes: When deploying a saved order any price changes that have occurred will be displayed and must be confirmed before deployment starts
* Create Server: When manually entering an IP address the subnet will be automatically pre-filled
* Saved Orders: Deploy action shortcut now available without first expanding saved order row

### Bug Fixes and General Updates

* Improved user feedback after a form has been submitted for processing
* Resolved: Internet Explorer currently cannot display the Global Navigation menu and versions before IE11 may experience errors that prevent the DCC UI from loading
* Resolved: Metrics related to disk size/space/utilization may show incorrect data
