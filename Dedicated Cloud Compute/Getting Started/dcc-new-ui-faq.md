**Q: Where can people see the holistic changes made to the DCC UI?**
A: The New DCC UI Changes and Updated Views Knowledge Base article has steps and updated images comparing the old and new UI.

**Q: Is there any training for learning about the new DCC UI?**
A: Internal documents and training have been created geared for internal CenturyLink (CTL) teams to learn and use the new DCC UI. The Onboarding team is welcome to adapt this content as needed for presentation to external Dedicated Compute Cloud (DCC) customers. With that in mind, some of the content covered herein is good for internal teams, but is not necessarily something external customers would care to know and/or understand (i.e., how the development teams did a complete overhaul of the backend to separate automation from business logic).

**Q: Do users need experience using the SavvisStation Portal?**
A: No experience with SavvisStation Portal (SSP) is required; however, it is assumed that most students will have seen the old/existing portal interface available through Symphony Orchestrator. Throughout the course there will be references to old/existing features (e.g., Compute Dashboard, Image Management, etc.), and how these concepts are presented in the new portal user interface (UI).

**A: What other assumptions are important to take note of when using the new UI?**
Q: Using the new DCC UI assumes the student (user) is familiar with the current DCC UI in regards to the major features, how to navigate, etc. Content in later modules will show how things appear in the new UI.

**A: Will there be a course offering in the future that is split into learning modules?**
