Lumen’s Compliance Management team is dedicated to continually improving and maintaining critical compliance certifications such as **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act** ([HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/)). Through our disciplined assessment and audit processes, Lumen has implemented comprehensive practices for HIPAA and **Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act** ([HITECH](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/enforcementrule/hitechenforcementifr.html)) leveraging widely recognized security standards such as: SSAE 16 SOC 1 and 2, and ISO 27001 to help enable our customers meet their privacy and security rules for **Protected Health Information** (PHI). HIPAA sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. Any company that deals with PHI must ensure that all the required physical, network and process security measures are in place and followed.

This includes **Covered Entities** (CE), anyone who provides treatment, payment and operations in healthcare, **Business Associates** (BA), and anyone with access to patient information that provides support in treatment, payment or operations. Subcontractors or business associates of business associates must also be in compliance.

The HIPAA **[Privacy Rule](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/privacyrule/)** addresses the saving, accessing and sharing of medical and personal information of any individual, while the HIPAA Security Rule more specifically outlines national security standards to protect heath data created, received, maintained or transmitted electronically, also known as **Electronic Protected Health Information** (ePHI).

CEs and their BAs can leverage Lumen to process, maintain and store ePHI. With the required controls in place in the customer’s environment (data encryption, access restrictions, etc.), Lumen will sign a **Business Associate Agreement** (BAA) that can be leveraged as part of a customer’s overall compliance program.

Additionally, Lumen can provide an Attest Engagement audit report in accordance with AT Section 101. This report demonstrates an independent service auditor has examined Lumen’s assertion that the description of its information security program for its network and hosting services provided in the report is fairly presented. It also demonstrates that the information security program governing the services adopts essential elements of the HIPAA Security Rule and for HITECH.

## What is a Covered Entity?
*Healthcare Provider* – A healthcare provider includes:
*	Doctors
*	Clinics
*	Psychologists
*	Dentists
*	Chiropractors
*	Nursing Homes
*	Pharmacies

They are only considered covered entities if they transmit any information in an electronic form in connection with a transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard.

*Healthcare Plan* – Healthcare plan includes organizations such as:
*	Health insurance companies
*	HMOs
*	Company health plans
*	Government programs that pay for health care, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the military and veterans health care programs

*Healthcare Clearinghouse* - This includes entities that process nonstandard health information they receive from another entity into a standard (i.e., standard electronic format or data content), or vice versa.

## PHI and ePHI
Lumen understands the importance of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI as the essence of the HIPAA Security Rule. Lumen conducts the required risk analysis, administrative safeguards, physical safeguards, technical safeguards, and ongoing due diligence when storing, transmitting and processing ePHI, to comply with the HITECH standards and credentials to enable its customers meet HIPAA compliance.

There is no dispute about the responsibilities of BA’s for the protection of ePHI, all BA’s are held as responsible as CE’s. Considering the latest notice of the Omnibus Final Rule that speaks to the extension of responsibilities from covered entities to business associates:

## United Security
*Traditional IaaS Approach* - Lumen operates on a United Responsibility model. Making cloud security everyone's responsibility ensures that our infrastructure and everything connected to it is safe. Lumen is responsible for the security of everything in our infrastructure; our customers are responsible for anything built on top of, or connected to that infrastructure.

*Hybrid IT Approach* – Lumen works with its customers to address their specific compliance needs by leveraging a “United Responsibility” security model depending on which services the client is required for Lumen to manage. As a recognized leader in Hybrid IT environments with the real-world experience to determine the right mix of technology, building blocks based on your business needs, workloads and end-user expectations with built in compliance requirements to meet most universally accepted security frameworks and standards.

Lumen identifies the right blend of IT services from a single capable and reliable provider.
Integrated and optimized solutions from multiple IT infrastructure models aligning technology capabilities with the needs of business.
*	Combining the best of your traditional IT with additional capabilities that your IT may not be able to deliver on its own.
*	Choose from individual offerings, co-managed, or fully managed solutions based on your business priorities.
*	All designed to meet your regulatory requirements from FISMA to HIPAA to PCI.

Compliance and security is obviously a top-level consideration whenever considering a move to a hybrid IT model. Security concerns have long been a factor preventing companies from either experimenting with or fully embracing a cloud environment. Organizations are rapidly assessing the gaps in their current security policies vs. the requirements necessary to align with compliant standards. For its customers to become or remain aligned with relevant compliant certifications and security frameworks, Lumen possesses the necessary third party generated certifications required.

## What is a HIPAA Compliant Data Center?
Lumen adheres to the administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and standards set forth by the HITECH act and developed an enterprise-wide information security management program to help its customers meet their information security and compliance requirements. Below is a list of safeguards Lumen’s program incorporates based on the elements of the HIPAA Security Rule and HITECH.

**Administrative Safeguards**
*	*Security Management Process* - Identify and analyze potential risks to its colocation and managed services, and implement security measures that reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level.
*	*Security Personnel* - Designate a security official who is responsible for developing and implementing its security policies and procedures.
*	*Information Access Management* - Implement policies and procedures for authorizing access to the network and hosting environment only when such access is appropriate based on the user or recipient's role.
*	*Workforce Training and Management* - Provide appropriate authorization and supervision of workforce members who work within its colocation and managed services. Train workforce members regarding its security policies and procedures, and applies appropriate sanctions against workforce members who violate its policies and procedures.
*	*Contingency Planning* - Implement policies and procedures to guide response to emergencies or other occurrence that could affect normal operations.
*	*Evaluation* - Perform a periodic assessment of how well its security policies and procedures meet the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule.
*	*Business Associate Contracts* - Implement contractual terms, policies and procedures to insure that business associates will appropriately safeguard customer data and information.

**Physical Safeguards**

## Service Audits
Lumen recognizes that some customers may need to conduct on-site audits of how their services are delivered. Lumen permits annual audits to ensure our customer’s services are aligned with security and policy requirements. The customer may perform this service audit or any designated third party auditor(s) who enters into a standard Auditor Access and Confidentiality Agreement.

## Characteristics of a Business Associate
When a covered entity decides to outsource HIPAA compliant hosting to a business associate, they need to look for certain indicators of compliance to ensure due diligence in vetting their service provider. Due diligence can help a covered entity prevent a potential data breach resulting in costly fines, as well as damage to reputation and business.

## HIPAA Attestation and Compliance Services Report
As the number of reported data breaches and the cost of data breaches to the healthcare industry rise, it becomes imperative for a CE to select a BA that has invested in an independent audit and can provide a copy of their audit report to ensure they are following compliant policies and procedures.

## HIPAA Certification vs. Compliance
Beware of claims to be “HIPAA certified.” There is no governing body or federally recognized HIPAA certification, for CE’s or BA’s alike. The correct term and usage is “HIPAA compliant,” meaning their policies, procedures, technology and staff implement security controls that are aligned with the HIPAA rules.

While, in some cases, certification may mean they have taken an unofficial exam and passed with knowledge of HIPAA-related material, it does not mean their facilities, staff or solutions are actually compliant with the HIPAA standards. It also does not mean using their services will make your company compliant.

## Other Data Center Audits
A HIPAA Attestation Letter is specific to healthcare and the protection of PHI, other Lumen audits can give you additional guidance and insight into ongoing compliance and level of operating standards, as well as the quality of service Lumen customers can expect to receive.

**[SOC 1](https://www.ctl.io/compliance/soc-1-ssae-16/)** - Lumen provides an annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16. The certification validates Lumen’s commitment to operational excellence and client satisfaction. The SSAE 16 SOC 1 Type 2 report indicates that an independent service auditor has formally evaluated and issued an opinion on the description of selected Lumen systems.

**[SOC 2](https://www.ctl.io/compliance/soc-2/)** - In addition to individual data center audits, Lumen also publishes a Service Organization Controls 2(SOC 2), Type II report. The SOC 2 report provides the auditor’s detailed evaluation of the design suitability and effectiveness of the controls. The design is required to meet the criteria for the security and availability principles set forth in TSP Section 100, Trust Services Principles, Criteria, and Illustrations for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.

**ISO 27001**
Lumen has received certification of the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management System (ISMS) Standard for data centers located in United States, Singapore, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. The certificate addresses global network services and managed hosting services in Asia and EMEA. As well as colocation services (including physical security and facilities management) for data centers in Asia, EMEA, and North America. ISO 27001 is an International Standard providing a model for establishing, operating, monitoring, and improving ISMS.

The ISO 27001 certification allows Lumen to demonstrate effective information security processes are defined and implemented. ISO 27001 conducts interim audits annually to support a three-year renewal cycle. The most recent renewal certification audit was completed in 2013.

*ISO 27001 key benefits*:
Includes security as part of the current quality system:
*	Provides an opportunity to identify and manage risks to key information and systems assets
*	Provides confidence and assurance to both partners and clients
*	Allows for an independent review and assurance of information security practices to customers

Lumen adopted ISO 27001 for a variety of reasons, including:
*	Protecting critical and sensitive information.
*	A holistic approach to secure information and compliance.
*	Credibility, trust, satisfaction and confidence with stakeholders, partners, citizens and customers.
*	Security status according to internationally accepted criteria.
*	Market differentiation due to prestige, image and external goodwill.
*	Globally accepted certification.

## Corporate Quality
At the core of all compliance programs are quality systems and the management of those quality systems, allowing the organization to establish a baseline from which it can plan, implement and measure. The program is used to demonstrate compliance and also to measure improvement. Coupled with its ISO certifications, Lumen maintains a customer advocacy function that has a formal charter to evaluate, control and improve the company’s Quality of Service (QoS) to both internal and external customers. Customer advocacy implements this directive through the management of various quality improvement programs.

### ITIL
Lumen strives to provide assurance to existing and future customers that its service standards are among the best in the industry. One way Lumen has done this is through implementation and adherence to industry best practices known as Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL).

Many of Lumen’s internal business units have adopted ITIL standards as the basis for management of their services. ITIL provides a comprehensive, consistent and coherent set of best practices for IT service management, promoting a quality approach to achieving efficient and effective business processes utilizing information systems.
