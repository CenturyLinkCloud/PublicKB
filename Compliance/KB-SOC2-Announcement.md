Lumen Cloud has completed its annual examination [SOC 2 Type 2](https://www.ctl.io/compliance/soc-2/) Report prepared in accordance with the [AICPA AT 101](http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/FRC/AssuranceAdvisoryServices/Pages/AICPASOC2Report.aspx).

Lumen SOC 2 Reports are examination engagements performed by a third party auditor in accordance with AT Section 101, Attest Engagements, of SSAEs (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements) using the predefined criteria as outlined in TSP section 100, Trust Services Principles, Criteria, and Illustrations for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy. A system is designed, implemented, and operated to achieve specific business objectives in accordance with management-specified requirements.

The SOC 2 Report specifically addresses one or more of the following five key system attributes:

* **Security** — The system is protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical).
* **Availability** — The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.
* **Processing Integrity** — System processing is complete, accurate, timely and authorized.
* **Confidentiality** — Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed.
* **Privacy** — Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed and disposed of in conformity with the commitments in the entity’s privacy notice, and with criteria set forth in Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) issued by the AICPA and Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants.

### Types of SOC 2 Reports
SOC 2 Reports are intended to meet our customers need for information and assurance about Lumen controls. There are two types of SOC 2 reports:

* **Type 1**
Report on management’s description of a service organization’s system and the suitability of the design of controls. Use of these reports is generally restricted.

* **Type 2**
Report on management’s description of a service organization’s system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls.

The 2015 SOC 2 report was compiled by the accounting firm [Moss Adams LLP](http://www.mossadams.com/services/advisory/information-technology/it-compliance/ssae-16). The certification validates Lumen’s commitment to operational excellence and client satisfaction. The SOC 2 Type 2 report covers the period from July 1, 2014 through July 1, 2015. A Type 2 examination means that an independent service auditor has formally evaluated and issued an opinion on the description of selected Lumen systems and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of applicable controls.
