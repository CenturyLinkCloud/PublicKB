### So what is a Business Associate Agreement?

The Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is not a contract for services or a typical non-disclosure agreement. It deals only with CenturyLink’s responsibilities as a [Business Associate](//www.ctl.io/compliance/hipaa/) (BA) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as amended. Most clients in the medical and dental professions are [Covered Entities](//www.ctl.io/compliance/hipaa/) (CE) under HIPAA because they collect, maintain, or process protected health information.

The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects all Protected Health Information (PHI) held or transmitted by a covered entity or **its business associate** (CenturyLink for certain services), in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. PHI includes "individually identifiable health information” that relates to: (i) the individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition; (ii) the provision of health care to the individual; or (iii) the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual; and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).

**CenturyLink’s Position**
CenturyLink has implemented an information security program, and conducted assessments of such program, for the Cloud services subject to HIPAA.

**Official Response**
CenturyLink will enter into a standard Business Associate Agreement (BAA) that can be leveraged as part of the customer’s overall HIPAA compliance program. Such a BAA is limited to those services in which CenturyLink is operating in the capacity of a BA to the customer and the customer remains responsible for its own HIPAA compliance.
