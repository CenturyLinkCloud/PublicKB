The Uptime Institute Management & Operations [(M&O)](//www.ctl.io/compliance/management-operations-stamp-of-approval/) Stamp of Approval encompasses a set of benchmarks and outcome-based behaviors that have been proven to support effective data center operations and reduce risk for both the operator and their customers. When applied and followed consistently, well-informed management practices, systematic and documented policies and procedures, and effective training regimens can insulate a data center from the majority of downtime risks. Organizations that have attained the M&O Stamp of Approval have successfully demonstrated leadership and commitment to operational excellence by meeting their assessment criteria.

The M&O Stamp of Approval provides a means to conduct risk analysis at a portfolio level and provide senior management with the information needed to make informed decisions on whether to accept the risk identified in the report or take corrective actions required to mitigate risks. Additionally, in today’s margin-centric world, the M&O Stamp of Approval allows companies to get the most of their facility and related assets and realize cost savings through these efforts.

The M&O behaviors are divided into five categories, with criteria in each that have been identified as necessary for a site to achieve its full uptime potential, reduce its risk of errors, and maintain efficient operations.
