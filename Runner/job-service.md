## Audience

This article is to support customers of Runner, a product that enables teams, developers, and engineers to quickly provision, interact, and modify their environments anywhere - CenturyLink Cloud, third-party cloud providers, and on-premises.  Additionally, the responses in this FAQ document are specific to using the service through the Control Portal.

## Job Service Overview

The Job Service is the primary component of the Runner product. Users can create, modify, and execute jobs at anytime. Many of the other services were created in tandem with the Job Service, and enhance the Job Execution capabilities. The Job Service accepts a payload that references a playbook to be used, whether that is using a public or private GitHub repository. When using a private GitHub repository, GitHub credentials are required.

The Job Service is a simple, text-based job and task definition. These jobs are executed by a highly available service with the ability to execute massively parallel tasks. It also provides the capability to schedule jobs at a defined interval.

The job actions can be performed via REST API calls. The API works with JSON messages over HTTP. It relies on the standard HTTP verbs including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

The URL format of the service is: `https://api.runner.ctl.io/{resource}/{account alias}`.

For example, to retrieve all the Jobs created at the account alias level, you would issue a GET request to `https://api.runner.ctl.io/jobs/XXXX`. The HTTP request must include headers Content-Type (set to application/json) and Authorization (set to ‘Bearer Token from authentication API’).

In addition to managing Runner Jobs the Job Service will allow you to define execution schedules for your Jobs.

### CREATE JOB <a id="CreateJob"></a>

Creates a Runner job in a given account. The Runner jobs have to be scripted plays using Ansible. Calls to this operation must include a token acquired from the authentication endpoint. See the [Login API](https://www.ctl.io/api-docs/v2/#authentication-login) for information on acquiring this token.

**When to use it**

Use this API operation when you would like to create a new job definition to execute the tasks specified in the referenced playbook. You also have the option to run it immediately or execute it later by issuing a start request.

#### URL
**Structure**

`POST https://api.runner.ctl.io/jobs/{accountAlias}?immediate=true|false`

**Example**

`POST https://api.runner.ctl.io/jobs/XXXX?immediate=false`

#### Request
**URI Parameters**

| NAME | TYPE |	DESCRIPTION	| REQ.|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accountAlias |	string |	Short code for a particular account. |	Yes |
| immediate	| boolean	| Set to “true” if the job to be executed immediately after creation. Default is “false”. |	No |

**Content Properties**

Playbooks can be executed in couple of different ways:

1. We recommend to have your playbook in a GitHubHib Repository for complex plays that are referencing multiple dependent playbooks/templates. Please refer to the Repository Entity information listed below.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| description	| string |	Description of the job. |	No |
| executionTtl |	integer |	You can mention the time in minutes expected for the job execution to be complete. If the execution doesn’t complete before the specified time, then it will be gracefully stopped. Default value is “180”. |	No |
