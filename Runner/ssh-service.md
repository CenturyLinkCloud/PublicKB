## Audience

This article is to support customers of Runner, a product that enables teams, developers, and engineers to quickly provision, interact, and modify their environments anywhere - CenturyLink Cloud, third-party cloud providers, and on-premises.  Additionally, the responses in this FAQ document are specific to using the service through the Control Portal.


## SSH Key Management Service Overview

Runner’s SSH Key Management Service will help you to manage and deploy SSH credentials on CenturyLink Cloud servers. With the keys deployed from this service, you can securely create and execute tasks using our Job service. The job actions can be performed via REST API calls. The API works with JSON messages over HTTP. It relies on the standard HTTP verbs including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

The URL format of the service is: `https://api.runner.ctl.io/keypairs/{accountAlias}`.

For example, to retrieve information of all deployed keypairs created at the account alias level, you would issue a GET request to `https://api.runner.ctl.io/keypairs/ALIAS`. Below are the various features of the service:

 - [Create Keypair](#CreateKeypair)
 - [Delete Keypair](#DeleteKeypair)
 - [Deploy Keypair](#DeployKeypair)
 - [Get Keypair](#GetKeypair)
 - [Deploy Keypair to Server Users](#DeployKeypairToServerUsers)
 - [Get Server Users](#GetServerUsers)
 - [Get Keypairs](#GetKeypairs)
 - [Undeploy Keypair for Server Users](#UndeployKeypairForServerUsers)


### CREATE KEYPAIR <a id="CreateKeypair"></a>

Creates an SSH Keypair and allows you to deploy those credentials to CenturyLink servers in your account.  The key can then be used to authenticate to these resources when executing a Runner Job. Calls to this operation must include a token acquired from the authentication endpoint. See the [Login API](https://www.ctl.io/api-docs/v2/#authentication-login) for information on acquiring this token.

**When to use it**

Use this API operation when you would like to create, deploy and manage SSH keys on CenturyLink servers.

Note: The SSH privateKey is generated only once, so you have to save the privateKey from the response.
