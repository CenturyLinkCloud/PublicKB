#### Audience

This article is to support customers of Relational DB Service, CenturyLink's MySQL-compatible database-as-a-service product.  Additionally, these instructions are specific to provisioning service directly through Control Portal.

## Overview

CenturyLink's Relational DB Service is a MySQL-compatible database-as-a-service that provides instant access to a database instance with SSL support, daily backups held for 7 days, basic monitoring and a replication option.  Users can configure the amount of CPU, Memory and Storage based on their database needs and can choose to replicate their instance in datacenter for a more highly available solution.  As customers' capacity needs grown, they can easily scale their CPU, RAM and/or Storage through the click of a button.  

For users that would like some sizing guidance, below are a few common configurations:

**Micro**|**Small**|**Medium**|**Large**|**X-Large**
-----------|-----------|--------------|------------ |------------
CPUs: 1 Core<br>Memory: 1 GB<br>Storage: 1 GB |CPUs: 1 Core<br>Memory: 2 GB<br>Storage: 1 GB|CPUs: 2 Core<br>Memory: 6 GB<br>Storage: 64 GB|CPUs: 4 Core<br>Memory: 16 GB<br>Storage: 256 GB |CPUs: 8 Core<br>Memory: 32 GB<br>Storage: 512 GB

4. Provide values for the amount of CPU, Memory and Storage to provision. You can view the monthly and hourly pricing for the selected configuration.
