### Audience
This article is to support customers of Relational DB Service, CenturyLink's database-as-a-service product. These instructions are specific to signing up for consumption alerts through the Control Portal.

### Overview
CenturyLink's Relational DB Service is a database-as-a-service that provides instant access to a database instance with SSL support, daily backups, basic monitoring, logs, metrics, and a replication option. Users can configure the amount of CPU, Memory, and Storage based on their database needs. They can choose to replicate their instance in datacenter for a more highly available solution. As the customer's capacity needs grown, they can easily scale their CPU, RAM, and/or Storage with the click of a button.
