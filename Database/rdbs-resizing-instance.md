### Audience
This article is to support customers of Relational Database service (RDBS), CenturyLink's database-as-a-service product. These instructions are specific to resizing a subscription through the Control Portal.

### Overview
CenturyLink's Relational Database service is a database-as-a-service that provides instant access to a database instance with SSL support, daily backups, basic monitoring, logs, metrics, and a replication option. Users can configure the amount of CPU, memory, and storage based on their database needs. They can choose to replicate their instance in a data center for a more highly available solution. As the customer's capacity needs grow, they can easily scale their CPU, RAM, and/or storage with the click of a button.

### Prerequisites
* access to the CenturyLink Cloud platform as an authorized user
* an existing RDBS instance

### Resizing an Existing Relational Database Instance
1. Browse to CenturyLink Cloud’s RDBS dashboard through the [Control Portal][1] or directly at [rdbs.ctl.io][2].

2. Under the tab "Databases", identify and select the database subscription you would like to resize. This takes you to a details screen specific to that subscription.

3. From the details screen, click the "resources" button. This brings up a new section of the screen with slide bars that allows you to select the new size of your instance.

4.  Make your new selections and click "save". You should then see the status change to "Configuring".
    - The dashboard will warn that the database will be restarted upon making any changes. However, this is not the case; only the following resize requests result in a database restart.  
    \- Increasing Memory  
    \- Decreasing Memory  
    \- Decreasing CPU
    - Storage can be scaled up, but cannot be scaled down through the API or UI.
    - New applicable hourly charges apply after successful resize.

**Note:** All changes to the RDBS instance will be locked until the change operations have completed.

**If you have questions or feedback, please submit them to our team by emailing [rdbs-help@ctl.io][4].**
