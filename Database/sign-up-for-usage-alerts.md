#### Audience

This article is to support customers of Relational DB Service, CenturyLink's MySQL-compatible database-as-a-service product.  Additionally, these instructions are specific to provisioning service directly through Control Portal.

## Overview

CenturyLink's Relational DB Service is a MySQL-compatible database-as-a-service that provides instant access to a database instance with SSL support, daily backups held for 7 days, basic monitoring and a replication option.  Users can configure the amount of CPU, Memory and Storage based on their database needs and can choose to replicate their instance in datacenter for a more highly available solution.  As customers' capacity needs grown, they can easily scale their CPU, RAM and/or Storage through the click of a button.
