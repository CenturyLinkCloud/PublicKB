### Audience
This article is to support customers of Relational DB Service, CenturyLink's database-as-a-service product.  These instructions are specific to getting started provisioning and using a MySQL-compatible instance directly through the Control Portal.

### Overview
CenturyLink's Relational DB Service is a database-as-a-service product that provides instant access to a MySQL-compatible database instance with SSL support, daily backups, restore functionality, logs, OS monitoring, notifications, and a replication option with auto-failover. Users can configure the amount of CPU, Memory, and Storage based on their database needs. Customers with High Available needs can choose to replicate their instance in-datacenter to meet their HA solution. As the customer's capacity needs grow, they can easily scale their CPU, RAM, and/or Storage with the click of a button.
For users who would like some sizing guidance, below are a few common configurations:

**Micro**|**Small**|**Medium**|**Large**|**X-Large**
-----------|-----------|--------------|------------ |------------
CPUs: 1       |CPUs: 1      |CPUs: 2       |CPUs: 4         |CPUs: 8
Memory: 1 GB  |Memory: 2 GB |Memory: 6 GB  |Memory: 16 GB   |Memory: 32 GB
Storage: 1 GB |Storage: 2 GB|Storage: 64 GB|Storage: 256 GB |Storage: 512 GB

5. Setup the Options section
   * If you would like your DB/Instance to be Replicated, move the slider. If selected, a replica of the primary database is created. Failover occurs when you manually push the fail-over button. Notice how estimated charges change when you choose Replication. 
   * If you would like to be notified when your CPU or Storage reaches 80% and 90% of capacity, move the slider to choose to "enable notifications".  This will then prompt you for an email address to be used for the notifications.
   * If you would like to define the time of day your backup is run, move the slider to choose "customize backup schedule" and select the time of day in UTC you would like backups to run. If no customization is made, backups will run at 0:00 UTC.
   * If you would like to change your backup retention period
   * If you would like to assign a Configuration Profile, just select it.
