### AppFog Overview

AppFog is a public Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that makes deploying scalable, robust, high performing [cloud-ready applications](http://12factor.net) fast and easy for developers. AppFog enables developers to focus on writing great applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. The result is increased agility and productivity, more efficient use of resources, and a simplified deployment and management experience.

AppFog supports the following common application runtimes: Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Go, Ruby, and Static Websites. Integrating with services such as databases, messaging middleware, load balancing, monitoring and more are easily provisioned through the AppFog Marketplace.

### Enable AppFog in Control Portal

Go to https://control.ctl.io, login, and you will see â€œAppFog" listed in the drop down navigation bar:

You may also navigate to AppFog via the icon on the left-side vertical navigation bar:

Navigate to AppFog using either navigation approach. Now it is time to enable deployment to AppFog regions, US East and/or US West. Each region has its own "add region" button to enable it in your AppFog:

If the region has already been enabled then a link will appear to send you to the region overview page and no "add region" button will be displayed on the region row.

### Where to Go From Here?

Now that you have AppFog enabled on your account you can manage membership to regions and spaces, login from  terminal and deploy an application.
