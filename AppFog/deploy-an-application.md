### Audience

Application developers

### Overview

We currently support applications using the following application runtimes in AppFog by default:

* [Java](deploy-java-application.md)
* [Node.js](deploy-nodejs-application.md)
* [Ruby](deploy-ruby-application.md)
* [PHP](deploy-php-application.md)
* Python
* Go
* [Static websites](deploy-static-website.md)

### Deploy Application

Once you have an application to deploy that is based on one of the supported application runtimes, you can deploy that application using the Cloud Foundry CLI or [from the Control Portal](deploy-applicaton-from-ui.md).

Here are the steps for deploying your application in the CLI:

* Go to the directory where your application source code is located
* Run the command `cf push [name of app]` to deploy it into AppFog (NOTE: [name of app] must be unique so be clever with name such as “theultimateapp-100”)
* After the process has finished you should see something similar to the following:

![Application Deployed Successfully](../images/appfog-app-deployed.png)

* Copy the URL from “urls” line and open that URL in a browser

You should now see your application running!
