### Overview

This article is intended to provide the available commands using the Cloud Foundry CLI `cf` tool, version 6.x. For more information refer to the [Cloud Foundry Docs](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf) or how to [Install the CLI Tool](login-using-cf-cli.md).

### Common Commmand examples

* Deploy an application using `cf push <APP_NAME>`. By default, the `cf push` command looks for a manifest.yml file in the current working directory. Use the -f option to provide a non-standard manifest location or filename. For more information refer to this document on [Using a Manifest File](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html). Here are possible options when pushing an application:
```
cf push APP_NAME [-b BUILDPACK_NAME] [-c COMMAND] [-d DOMAIN] [-f MANIFEST_PATH] [--docker-image DOCKER_IMAGE]
   [-i NUM_INSTANCES] [-k DISK] [-m MEMORY] [-n HOST] [-p PATH] [-s STACK] [-t TIMEOUT] [-u HEALTH_CHECK_TYPE] 
   [--no-hostname] [--no-manifest] [--no-route] [--no-start]
```
This example deploys an application named `example-app` with 2 instances, each with a memory allocation of 256M,  and using a specific buildpack:
```
cf push example-app -i 2 -m 256M -b https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/php-buildpack.git#af_custom_php
```
* List all provisioned applications:
```
cf apps
```
* View detailed information on a specific application, including state, CPU usage, memory:
```
cf app <APP_NAME>
```
* Get a dump of application logs in the Loggregator buffer:
```
cf logs <APP_NAME> --recent
```
* To obtain an active stream of the application logs:
```
cf logs <APP_NAME>
```
* View the files in an application directory:
```
cf files <APP_NAME>
```
* Users have the ability to navigate to a specific directory or view the contents of a file:
```
cf files <APP_NAME> path/to/file-to-view
```
* Show recent events for an application:
```
cf events <APP_NAME>
```
* Scale the number of appliation instances:
```
cf scale <APP_NAME> -i <NUMBER_OF_INSTANCES>
```
* Scale the memory reservation for an application, for example 128M, 1G. **Note**, scaling memory reservation will restart the application:
```
cf scale <APP_NAME> -m <DESIRED_MEMORY>
```
* View the current User, targeted Space and Org using `cf target`. Change the targeted Space or Org using the `-s` or `-o` options. For example, to change the targeted Space:
```
cf target -s <SPACE>
```
