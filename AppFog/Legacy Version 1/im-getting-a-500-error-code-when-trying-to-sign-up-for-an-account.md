<h4>This could be due to 2 things:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you were a free user through early May 2014 and did not upgrade your account, or reply to the email sent to our users, your account has been deleted.</p>
<p>Free accounts were deleted during a push to remove inactive free users from our infrastructure. We sent out several emails in regards to our customers, but you can find some information about the process on <a href="https://blog.appfog.com/changes-to-appfog-free-plans/">our blog</a>. The gist of it is that more than 95% of the abuse to our infrastructure was performed by users with free accounts. In order to improve the internet presence and functionality of AppFog for our paying customers, we decided to cease providing free accounts in February 2014 and removed non-active free accounts in May.</p>
<p>If you'd like, we can free up your email address so that you may sign up for a new plan. We provide free 30-day trials for our customers that sign up for most of our plans. If you have any questions, feel free email to our <a href="mailto:support@appfog.com">support team</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have cancelled your account recently, especially after the maintenance in early May removing inactive free accounts, your account has likely been deleted. All you need to do in this case is <a>submit a ticket</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@appfog.com">our support team</a> to free up that email address so you may sign up for an account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
