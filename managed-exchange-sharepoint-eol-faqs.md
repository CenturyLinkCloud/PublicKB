### Managed Exchange/SharePoint Service End-of-Sale and End-of-Life

As a service provider, CenturyLink continuously evaluates and updates its product catalog in order to provide competitive services. Occasionally, changing market conditions support a strategic decision to discontinue a product or service. That is why we’re announcing the End-of-Sale and End-of-Life for our Managed Exchange/SharePoint Service.

The End-of-Sale is effective immediately, and End-of-Life is December 31, 2019.

We realize that discontinuing this service may create an inconvenience for customers, which is why we're committed to supporting affected customers through a service transition and making that experience as seamless as possible.
