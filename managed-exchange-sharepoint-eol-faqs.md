### Managed Exchange/SharePoint Service End-of-Sale and End-of-Life

As a service provider, Lumen continuously evaluates and updates its product catalog in order to provide competitive services. Occasionally, changing market conditions support a strategic decision to discontinue a product or service. That is why we’re announcing the End-of-Sale and End-of-Life for our Managed Exchange/SharePoint Service.

The End-of-Sale is effective immediately, and End-of-Life is December 31, 2019.

We realize that discontinuing this service may create an inconvenience for customers, which is why we're committed to supporting affected customers through a service transition and making that experience as seamless as possible.  

### FAQ

**Q: What options does Lumen provide as a comparable service?**

**A**: [Lumen’s Microsoft Office 365](https://www.centurylink.com/business/hybrid-it-cloud/office-365.html) is recommended as a comparable service. Microsoft Office 365 allows you to communicate easily with email, shared calendars, instant messaging, and even video conferencing. It includes online versions of Exchange, Outlook, Skype for Business, SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, Office Applications, and premium anti-malware protection. Lumen has several Microsoft Office 365 plans to choose from, some with downloadable options.  All  plans are available as a monthly subscription, with no long-term commitment required.

To further explore Lumen’s Microsoft Office 365 option and plans, please contact your CSP or Sales Representative. If you are not sure who to contact, please reach out to [managedserviceslifecycle@centurylink.com](mailto:managedserviceslifecycle@centurylink.com) for assistance.

**Q: What option does Lumen provide as a comparable service to Outlook Backup or other third-party archiving solutions I have with my Manage Exchange service?**

**A**: If you are migrating your Managed Exchange to a [Lumen Office 365](https://www.centurylink.com/business/hybrid-it-cloud/office-365.html) plan, we recommend you consider adding our [MessageSolution Email Archiving and eDiscovery](https://apps.centurylink.com/support/knowledgebase/product-overview-messagesolution-email-archiving-and-ediscovery) for $3.99 per user per month. MessageSolution provides a robust, rules-based archive solution that will protect your data.  With MessageSolution from Lumen, users can gain fast, easy access to archived messages directly from Outlook, web browsers, offline archiving and more, making it convenient to find old emails when they’re needed. Powered by a built-in full text search engine and database, it can search through millions of emails within seconds.

Ask your CSP or your Lumen onboarding and migration technician for more details.

**Q: What does the transition to Lumen Office 365 look like?**

**A**: Once you have purchased the best plan for your business, a Lumen engineer from our Fast Forward Onboarding team will work with you to set up the new tenant, activate and configure your email accounts, download the apps (if applicable) and configure your apps, counsel on effective security configuration policies, and even give your admin key survival tips for day-to-day account management.  Your 1:1 onboarding appointment will start with an overview and confirmation of scope, and then we will safely migrate email, calendar and contact data, doing validation and testing before final cut over to ensure minimal downtime and no data loss.  In most cases, end users experience no downtime at all.

If your end users need help in making a smooth transition to Office 365, we also offer private webinars for up to 75 employees, starting at $200 per one hour session. Ask your Fast Forward On-boarding technician for more details during your first meeting.  Lumen will provide migration services at no charge.
