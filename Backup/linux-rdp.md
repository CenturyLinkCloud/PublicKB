The new Simple Backup Service (SBS) currently requires a web browser to perform restore operations. If you do not want to [allow remote web based connections to the Backup Agent](sbs-agent-security.md), you may want to connect directly to the machine via RDP and use a web browser and connect to the local serverâ€™s SBS web interface. It is relatively simple to add a desktop with RDP capability to a Linux server to be able to easily establish a typical RDP session to a remote Linux server and get a desktop complete with browser etc.

### Steps  
Here are the commands to install RDP services on a remote RHEL6x, RHEL7x, CentOS6x, and CentOS7x servers.
Other OSes and versions may have similar procedures.
```
# RHEL6x 
####### 
# Establish a remote SSH session as root and install and configure a desktop with RDP on RHEL6x 
# Install a full desktop 
yum -y groupinstall "Desktop Platform"

# Install RDP services 
yum -y install xrdp tigervnc-server

# Start the RDP service manually now 
/etc/init.d/xrdp start

# Install a web browser 
yum -y install firefox

# You may now RDP to Linux from Windows 
# NOTE1: Set mstsc to use 16bit High Color (24bit / 32bit will NOT work) 
# NOTE2: You may want to login as a non-root user to get access to normal icons and programs
```
```
# RHEL7x 
####### 
# Establish a remote SSH session as root and install and configure a desktop with RDP on RHEL7x 
# Install a full desktop 
yum -y groups install "Server with GUI"

# Install RDP services 
yum -y install xrdp tigervnc-server

# Allow a rule to allow RDP through the OS firewall 
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=3389/tcp

# Restart the firewall so the new RDP rule becomes effective 
firewall-cmd --reload

# Set the RDP service to auto-start at boot-time 
systemctl enable xrdp.service

# Start the RDP service manually now 
systemctl start xrdp.service

# You may now RDP to Linux from Windows 
# NOTE: Set mstsc to use 16bit High Color (24bit / 32bit will NOT work)
```
```
# CentOS6x 
######### 
# Establish a remote SSH session as root and install and configure a desktop with RDP on CentOS6x 
# Install a full desktop 
yum -y groupinstall desktop

# Install RDP services 
yum -y install xrdp tigervnc-server

# Start the RDP service manually now 
/etc/init.d/xrdp start

# Install a web browser 
yum -y install firefox

# You may now RDP to Linux from Windows 
# NOTE1: Set mstsc to use 16bit High Color (24bit / 32bit will NOT work) 
# NOTE2: You may want to login as a non-root user to get access to normal icons and programs
```
```
# CentOS7x 
########## 
# Establish a remote SSH session as root and install and configure a desktop with RDP on CentOS7x 
# Install a full desktop 
yum -y groups install "Server with GUI"

# Install RDP services 
yum -y install xrdp tigervnc-server

# Allow a rule to allow RDP through the OS firewall 
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=3389/tcp
