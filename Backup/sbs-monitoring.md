The Simple Backup Service has monitoring functionality now available through email notifications. Email notifications are available for either failed or successful backups, as well as a nightly backup email report of all activity.

To get started simply navigate to the Monitoring tab in the Simple Backup UI, add an email address to receive the notifications, and check the boxes for the notifications you would like.

We also have realtime monitoring available through Webhooks. Please see our [Webhooks KB article](webhooks.md) for more information.
