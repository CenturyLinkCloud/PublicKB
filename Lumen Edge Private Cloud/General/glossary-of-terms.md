**"Bring Your Own IP"**: Customers use their IP address in a migration.

**Catalog**: A catalog is a container for vApp templates and media files in an organization. Organization administrators and catalog authors can create catalogs in an organization. Catalog contents can be shared with other users in the organization and can also be published to all organizations in the vCloud Director installation.

**Client-to-Site VPN**: A VPN client on the remote user's computer or mobile device connects to a VPN gateway on the organization's network. The gateway typically requires the device to authenticate its identity.

**DCC**: Dedicated Cloud Compute 

**Hyperconvergence**: A type of infrastructure system with a software-centric architecture that tightly integrates compute, storage, networking and virtualization resources and other technologies from scratch in a commodity hardware box supported by a single vendor.

**Multiple NAT/Double NAT**: NAT (Network Address Translation) is being performed on a router, but additionally on another device connected in front of it resulting in double NAT. The public/private network boundary doesn't exist on the router as it is on the other device(s), which means that both the WAN and LAN sides of the router are private networks. Double NAT is a scenario where multiple routers on network are doing network address translation.

**NAT**: Network Address Translation

**NSX**: A virtual networking and security software product family created from VMware's vCloud Networking and Security (vCNS) and Nicira Network Virtualization Platform (NVP) intellectual property.

**Site-to-Site VPN**: Site-to-site VPN allows offices in multiple fixed locations to establish secure connections with each other over a public network such as the Internet. Site-to-site VPN extends the company's network, making computer resources from one location available to employees at other locations.

**Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC)**:  A data center facility where the elements of the infrastructure are virtualized and delivered as a service and where the provisioning and operation is abstracted from the hardware and fully implemented through software.

**Software-defined Networking (SDN)**: Software-defined networking is an umbrella term encompassing several kinds of network technology aimed at making the network as agile and flexible as the virtualized server and storage infrastructure of the modern data center.

**Solid-State Drive (SSD)**: A solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently.

**SSL offloading**: Relieves a Web server of the processing burden of encrypting and/or decrypting traffic sent via SSL, the security protocol that is implemented in every Web browser. The processing is offloaded to a separate device designed specifically to perform SSL acceleration or SSL termination.

**vApp**: Stands for Virtual Application and consists of one or more virtual machines that communicate over a network and use resources and services in a deployed environment. A vApp can contain multiple virtual machines.

**vCloud Director Extender**: VMware vCloud Director Extender is a hybrid cloud solution that enables cloud providers and tenants to expand multi-tier applications and perform workload migrations between on-premise data centers and the cloud.

**vCloud Director (vCD)**: VMware Inc.'s cloud computing management tool. It manages Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) architectures by monitoring and controlling various cloud-computing components, such as security, virtual machine (VM) provisioning, billing and self-service access.

**Cloud Foundation Architecture**: VMware Cloud Foundation™ is VMware’s new unified Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) platform for private and public clouds. Cloud Foundation brings together VMware vSphere® (compute), vSAN™ (storage), and NSX® (network) virtualization into a natively integrated stack through automation and lifecycle management capabilities of the new VMware SDDC Manager™.

**vLAN**: A virtual LAN (vLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2)

**VSAN**: Virtual Storage Area Network, which is a software-defined storage offering from VMware that enables enterprises to pool their storage capabilities and to instantly and automatically provision virtual machine storage via simple policies that are driven by the virtual machine.

**Template**: A VMware template (also called a golden image) is a perfect, model copy of a virtual machine (VM) from which an administrator can clone, convert or deploy more virtual machines.
