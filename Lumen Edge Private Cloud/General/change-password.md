### Description
In this KB article, we describe how to change the password on VMs that are deployed using our default "CTL-Golden-Images" vApp Templates in Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundationâ„¢.

### Steps
Login to your Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation environment.

  ![Login to Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation](../../images/dccf/login-html5.png)

Once logged in, click __Virtual Machines__ in the menu on the left side of the screen, then select the __VM__ in which you want to change the password.

__Please note:__ The VM must be powered off before we can proceed with this process. Also, VM Tools must be installed on the VM.

In the properties page of the VM, click __Guest OS Customization__.

In the __Guest OS Customization__ section, ensure __Enable guest customization__ and __Allow local administrator password__ are selected, the type in your desired password next to __Specify password__, then scroll down and click __SAVE__.

Once the save is completed, click __Virtual Machines__ in the menu on the left side of the screen, then click on the vertical ellipsis for the __VM__ in which you changed the password, then select __Power On and Force Recustomization__ to enact your changes.

You will see the __Status__ change from __Powered off__ to __Forcing customization__.

Once the __Status__ changes to __Powered on__, the password on your VM will be set as desired. If you have other VMs you would like to deploy with this password and configuration, you can click on __vApps__ in the menu on the left side of the screen, then click on the vertical ellipsis for the __VM__ in which you changed the password, then select __Add to Catalog...__. Name it, customize it, then use that vApp Template to deploy from.
