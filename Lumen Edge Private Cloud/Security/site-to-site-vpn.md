### Description
This KB article steps through the process to stand up a Site-to-Site VPN between Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundationâ„¢ (LPC on VCF) and Lumen Cloud (CLC).

### Prerequisites
* LPC on VCF account.
* CLC account.
* Local Endpoint (Public IP for IPsec VPN on the LPC on VCF side).
* Local Subnets in CIDR format (local networks to be accessible to IPsec VPN on the LPC on VCF side).
* Peer Endpoint (Public IP for IPsec VPN on the CLC side).
* Peer subnets in CIDR format (local networks to be accessible to IPsec VPN on the CLC side).
* Firewall ports IP Protocol ID 50 (ESP), UDP Port 500 (IKE), and UDP Port 4500 are configured on both ends.

### Steps
Log in to your Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation environment.

  ![Login to Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation](../../images/dccf/login-html5.png)

Once logged in, click the Virtual Data Center summary box.

* Click __Edges__ in the menu on the left side of the screen, 
* Select your Edge Gateway.
* Click __IPSec VPN__. 
* Click __EDIT__.

Log in to your Lumen Cloud environment.

  ![IPsec VPN Sites](../../images/dccf/s2svpn6.png)

In the left pane, click __Network__, and then select __Site-To-Site VPN__.

  ![IPsec VPN Sites](../../images/dccf/s2svpn7.png)

In the __Site-to-Site VPN__ page, click the __+ SITE TO SITE VPN__ button.

  ![IPsec VPN Sites](../../images/dccf/s2svpn8.png)

In the __Create Site-to-Site VPN__ page, select your __Control Portal Site__ (CLC data center), and then click on the __ADD NETWORK BLOCK__ button.

  ![IPsec VPN Sites](../../images/dccf/s2svpn9.png)

In the __Select Destination Network or Subnet__ page, select your __network, subnet size__ and __starting ip address__, and then click __ADD NETWORK BLOCK__.

  ![IPsec VPN Sites](../../images/dccf/s2svpn10.png)

In __Create Site-to-Site VPN__ page, in the __Your Site__ section, enter your __Site Name, Device Type and VPN Peer IPv4 Address__, and then click the __ADD NETWORK BLOCK__ button.

  ![IPsec VPN Sites](../../images/dccf/s2svpn11.png)

Upon clicking the __ADD NETWORK BLOCK__ button above, a new field appears named __Tunnel Encrypted Subnets__. Enter your local network subnet block (on the LPC on VCF side). Click __next: phase 1__.

  ![IPsec VPN Sites](../../images/dccf/s2svpn12.png)

In the __Phase 1 (IKE)__ page, enter as follows:
  - __IKE Protocol:__ IKEv1
  - __Protocol Mode:__ Main
  - __Encryption Algorithm:__ AES-256
  - __Hashing Algorithm:__ SHA1 (96)
  - __Pre-Shared Key:__ Same pre-shared key you used previously
  - __Diffie-Hellman Group:__ Group 2
  - __Lifetime Value:__ 8 hours
  - __DPD State:__ On
  - __NAT-T State:__ Default

Click __next: phase 2__

  ![IPsec VPN Sites](../../images/dccf/s2svpn13.png)

In the __Phase 2 (IPSEC)__ page, enter as follows:
  - __IPSEC Protocol:__ ESP
  - __Encryption Algorithm:__ AES-256
  - __Hashing Algorithm:__ SHA1 (96)
  - __PFS Enabled:__ On, Group 2
  - __Lifetime Value:__ 1 hour

Click __finish__

To test the Site-To-Site VPN, try pinging the gateway of a tunneled subnet of the other side, i.e., ping from a VM in CLC on the 10.100.67.0/24 network to the gateway on the LPC on VCF side - 10.23.30.1.
