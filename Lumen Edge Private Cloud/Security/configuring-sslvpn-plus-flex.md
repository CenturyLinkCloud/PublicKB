### Description
You have this new Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundationâ„¢ environment, but how do you securely connect to your servers? Some customers have the option of using a site-to-site VPN tunnel, MPLS, Cloud Network Service, etc. If your company doesn't have these options available, follow the steps below to configure SSL VPN-Plus with the suggested settings, so that you can provide secure access to your environment.

Once you are done with this configuration, take a look at [How to Securely Connect](how-to-securely-connect.md) for the client portion of this.

### Steps
* Login to your Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation environment.

  ![Login to Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation](../../images/dccf/login-to-dcc-f.png)

* In the __Users__ tab, create SSL VPN-Plus user accounts so that they can connect to download the SSL VPN-Plus client, and then in turn, connect to the SSL VPN. Create accounts by clicking the __+__ and entering the relevant information. It is recommended that no shared accounts are created &mdash; this aligns with the setting in the General Settings tab as mentioned above.

* The __IP Pools__ tab allows you to create pools of IP addresses that will be assigned to the VPN clients that connect to the SSL VPN-Plus service. It is recommended that you add an IP Pool using addresses that don't exist in any network within your Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation environment. Create IP Pools by clicking the __+__ and entering the IP Range, Gateway and Netmask, at a minimum. You must also ensure the Status of the IP Pool is enabled.

  ![SSL VPN-Plus](../../images/dccf/configuring-sslvpn-plus8.png)

* In the __Installation Packages__ tab, click the __+__ to create a new SSL VPN-Plus client installation package. We recommend that you create one package for all OS types (Windows, Linux, Mac). The Gateway address is an IPv4 address that has been assigned as a Sub-Allocated IP Pool in the Edge Gateway Properties. This must be an IP address that is not used by anything else within your Lumen Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation environment.

* In the __Private Networks__ tab, add the existing networks that have been defined, so that VPN clients can access the resources on those networks.

  ![SSL VPN-Plus](../../images/dccf/configuring-sslvpn-plus10.png)

* In the __Server Settings__ tab, select the IPv4 address you assigned as the Gateway in the Installation Package, and enter the port number. You must also ensure Enabled has been selected.
