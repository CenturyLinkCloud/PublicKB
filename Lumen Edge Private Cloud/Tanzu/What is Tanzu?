### Description

Tanzu is a portfolio of products that enable enterprises to modernize both their applications and the infrastructure they run on. Tanzu is meant to provide operations teams the tools necessary to run modern applications and manage the underlying infrastructure.

The additional virtualized components consist of the following:

* 3 node supervisor cluster enabled through vSphere.
* 1 vSphere Content Library to synchronize and make available the Tanzu Kubernetes OVAs for guest cluster deployment. 
* A default cluster namespace configured at time of deployment.
* Updated VCD UI plugin and provider setup that enables Self Service Guest Tanzu Kubernetes cluster deployment via the VCD tenant portal.
