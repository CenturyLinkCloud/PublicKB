## Creating a managed server is easy.
From the Control Portal menu, select “Create Server.” Then, select the data center, group membership, and other VM properties. Make sure to select a data center that supports managed services, and then click the “managed server” element to “Yes.” The operating system drop-down menu will automatically refresh to show available options. Choose your desired OS, then proceed with the remainder of the server creation process.

## Then What Happens?
After creating a managed VM, the VM will be 'Under Construction' while background processes are completed. You will not have access to the server during that time; you will receive a notification via email once the operation has completed (allow up to a 30 minutes). If there are any issues, contact us via email [request@centurylink.com](mailto:request@centurylink.com) or by phone at the following numbers:
