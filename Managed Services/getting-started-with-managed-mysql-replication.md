### Overview
We offer two options of MySQL replication:
* [Master-Slave Replication](//dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication.html): Enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to be copied (typically asyncronous) to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves).  
* [Master-Master Replication](//dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysql-cluster-replication-multi-master.html): Enables data from **any** Master MySQL database server to be copied (typically syncronous) to other master nodes.  **CenturyLink Cloud Managed MySQL Services only supports (2) nodes currently.**

This guide provides (2) unique options and customers should evaluate their needs to decide which fits business requirements.

### Prerequisites

* [Data Center must support Managed Services](../General/centuryLink-cloud-feature-availability-matrix.md)
* [Deploy (2) Managed RHEL 6/7 Servers](../Managed Services/created-a-managed-server-now-what.md) or [Convert existing RHEL 6/7 Servers to Managed](../Managed Services/converting-unmanaged-virtual-machines-to-managed.md)
* [Deploy Managed MySQL Services to the Servers](../Managed Services/getting-started-with-managed-mysql.md)

### Creating a Managed MySQL Master-Master Replication Service using Blueprints

1. Search for the **CLC Managed MySQL Master Master Replication** Blueprint in the Blueprint library. Select the Blueprint, followed by the deploy blueprint button.

      ![MySQL Multi-Master Blueprint](../images/getting-started-with-managed-mysql-replication-01.png)

2. Fill out the appropriate details for the Blueprint.

    * Master Server MySQL Password: The password for the MySQL account on **Node 1 of the Master-Master configuration**. Note: This should be the password used when MySQL was configured and can be found at /root/.mysqlclc
    * Slave Server Host Name: In a Master-Master configuration this is the **name of the secondary node** you wish to be part of the Master-Master replication configuration.
    * Slave Server MySQL Password:  The password for the MySQL account on **Node 2 of the Master-Master configuration**. Note: This should be the password used when MySQL was configured and can be found at /root/.mysqlclc</b></li>
    * Install Managed MySQL Master Master Replication: Select **Node 1 of the Master-Master** configuration.
    * Install Managed MySQL Master Master Replication: Select **Node 1 of the Master-Master** configuration.
    * Register Managed MySQL Replication: Select **Node 1 of the Master-Master** configuration.
