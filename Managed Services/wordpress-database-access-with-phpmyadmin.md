WordPress uses a MySQL relational database for storing and retrieving content like posts, pages, image paths and comments as well as user login information.

At times it is necessary to manage the database to resolve issues or add functionality.  With your CenturyLink Cloud WordPress site this is achieved via the free php software tool, [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net "phpMyAdmin Homepage").
