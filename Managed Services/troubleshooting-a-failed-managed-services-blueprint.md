<p>If a Managed Services Blueprint does not complete as expected, please note the OS and the time the Blueprint was attempted. RHEL Managed Services Blueprints will fail from 9am to 10am UTC as a result of regular maintenance in our managed services infrastructure. Please wait one hour before attempting again.</p>

<p>If that is not the issue, follow these steps to expedite troubleshooting.</p>
