After deploying SafeHaven and the monitoring system, CenturyLink shares with customer the credentials to log into SafeHaven console to view the solution. Customer can edit certain fields to accommodate the solution and their daily workloads. To ensure the integrity of the solution, it is highly recommended that customer ONLY edit the fields listed below. Customer can also ask for assistance or recommendation from CenturyLink before editing them. 

#### 1. Log into the SafeHaven Console

For each of the protection group, you are able to see the protection group information including protected servers, WAN sync speed, recovery point information and storage usage etc.

#### 4. Edit Checkpoint Interval 

Checkpoint is a recovery point used to perform test failover and failover of a protection group. Checkpoint interval is a time span the checkpoint is taken. Checkpoint interval can be as low as 30 seconds. You can change the checkpoint interval to align with your DR strategy.  You can also check all the checkpoints via SafeHaven console.

#### 7. Failover A Protection Group

When disaster happens, right click on the protection group and choose Failover option. Normally we recommend Customer have a conversation with CenturyLink first before invoking a failover operation.
