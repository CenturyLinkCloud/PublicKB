<p>Here's how to get started with Managed Active Directory in CenturyLink Cloud. <strong>NOTE: Before you can deploy Managed Active Directory, you must create a Managed Windows server. </strong><strong>Also, please ensure that two or more Domain Controllers have been built in your deployment, as this is a necessary component for servers to be added into your Domain. If this is not possible, all server builds will be added into the shared Active Directory Domain.</strong>
</p>

<p>1. Navigate to the Blueprints Library, and search for "Active Directory". Click on the “CLC Managed Active Directory – Add DC” Blueprint.</p>
