CenturyLink Cloud WordPress sites utilize Object Storage for persistent WordPress content files such as images and file attachments.  In order to utilize persistent storage you must first have a CenturyLink Cloud manually configure Centurylink Cloud Object Storage using the following link:

[Using object storage from the control portal](../Object Storage/using-object-storage-from-the-control-portal.md)

Once object storage has been configured, you must edit your base  WordPress *wp-config.php* file on http://www.github.com to integrate your Wordpress site with your object storage account.
