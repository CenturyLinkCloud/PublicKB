### Details

Monitoring alerts from Managed, CLC servers are enriched with your company's data, including your primary technical point of contact, and presented to the Global Operations team. After reviewing the issue, the Operations team will either resolve the issue or reach out to your primary technical contact.

You are encouraged to set up a primary technical contact by contacting Support as soon as possible. If you have not set up a primary technical contact, the default contact will be an arbitrary contact associated with your account. **The primary technical contact is NOT retrieved from the notification contacts you may have identified in Control Portal.** The notification users in the Control Portal will be recipients of alerts directly from the portal.

If you have specific or detailed contact strategies and/or remediation requirements for your servers, you are encouraged to contact Support. Your requirements will be documented and presented to Operations whenever they review alerts coming from your servers.

If you wish to set up maintenance activity, such as an update, please contact Support. During the time you schedule, alerts will be suppressed and prevent unnecessary and confusing contacts for you.

The following monitors have default settings at the time the servers are made managed, but can be adjusted by making a request with operations. If you have any questions about what other monitors are available, you are encouraged to contact support.
