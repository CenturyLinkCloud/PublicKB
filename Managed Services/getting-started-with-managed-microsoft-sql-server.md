### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is the CenturyLink Cloud for Managed Microsoft SQL priced?**

A: Please see [Pricing Catalog](//www.ctl.io/pricing/) for more information.

**Q: How do I request MSSQL Mirroring or MSSQL AlwaysOn Configuration?**

A: Database Mirroring or SQL AlwaysOn configuration are available as Service Tasks. For your existing Managed MSSQL instance(s), you can request configuration of Database Mirroring or SQL AlwaysOn by opening a Service Task ticket. You can find more information on what Service Tasks are available and how to request them in our [Requesting Service Tasks on CenturyLink Cloud](//www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/service-tasks/requesting-service-tasks-on-centurylink-cloud) article.

Service Tasks are billed at a rate of $195 per hour.

You can find more information and pricing for these Service Tasks: 
[AlwaysOn](//www.ctl.io/service-tasks/#mssql-alwayson-configuration)
[Mirroring](//www.ctl.io/service-tasks/#mssql-database-mirroring)

**Q: Can the customer have multiple MS SQL instances installed on the same server?**

A: Not at this time.

**Q: Can the customer provide their own MS SQL Licenses?**

A: Please see [Managed SQL with BYOL](#managed-sql-with-byol) for details.

**Q: How are licensing costs incurred?**

A: SQL licenses costs are calculated discretely from the Managed MSSQL hourly costs, and is based on the MSSQL edition and number of allocated vCPUs on the virtual machine. Please see our [Pricing Catalog](//www.ctl.io/pricing/#/va1) for more information.

**Q: Can un-managed Microsoft SQL Instances be converted to Managed (or vice versa)?**

A: Existing Virtual Machines can be converted to Managed Virtual Machines, and then MSSQL can be registered, or installed and registered, as a Managed Service. We do not currently support converting a Managed Server or Service to Unmanaged due to licensing restrictions.
