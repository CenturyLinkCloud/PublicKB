### Overview
[CenturyLink Cloud Managed Operating System Services](//www.ctl.io/managed-services/operating-system/) provide maintenance and management of your Windows & Red Hat cloud servers, 24x7.  For a flat hourly fee, our engineers will perform support and administrative functions on your behalf.

Customers may wish to enable Managed OS on virtual machines already deployed in an **unmanaged** state to offload critical IT functions.  In order to facilitate this process the CenturyLink Cloud platform provides an automated [Blueprint](//www.ctl.io/blueprints/) to convert unmanaged virtual machines into a managed operating system.

Of course, you may also consider using the CenturyLink Cloud API to handle these actions programmatically. What follows is the simplest method, via the Control Portal.

### Audience

Users employed by companies that have agreed to terms with [CenturyLink Sales](http://www.centurylink.com/) for the CenturyLink Cloud product.

### Prerequisites
* An understanding of the standard server creation process.
* Some idea of the benefits included with [managed servers](../Managed Services/managed-operating-system-frequently-asked-questions.md)


### Important Information
* Conversion from **Managed** to **Unmanaged** Operating System Services is not currently a supported feature.
* It is advised that customers perform the conversion during a maintenance window due to potential impact on running services.
* It is recommended to create a snapshot of the VM before running the management process
* Normally, a single CPI Blueprint will take between ten and thirty minutes to complete. However, this can be influenced by jobs in the queue
* To preconfigure network access, prior to making an unmanaged VM Managed, please be sure at least one [new, managed server](../Managed Services/created-a-managed-server-now-what.md) has been created in the desired VLAN/Network.


### Compatibility Matrix

### Converting Unmanaged Windows Virtual Machines to Managed
1. In the Control Portal, navigate to the Blueprint Library and select a Cloud location that supported managed operating system services.

2. Using the search feature, input **CPI** to filter the blueprints.

3. Choose the **Managed-Win for CPI** blueprint and select the deploy blueprint icon.

4. In Step 1 (customize blueprint) select the Windows Virtual Machine you wish to convert to a managed server.  Each of the 4 customization areas **require** the user to select the virtual machine you wish to convert and all of them should be set to the same instance.

5. In Step 2 validate your inputs and select the deploy blueprint button.

### Converting Unmanaged Linux Virtual Machines to Managed
1. In the Control Portal, navigate to the Blueprint Library and select a Cloud location that supported managed operating system services.

3. Choose the **Managed-RHEL for CPI** blueprint and select the deploy blueprint icon.

4. In Step 1 (customize blueprint) select the Linux Virtual Machine you wish to convert to a managed server.  Each of the 3 customization areas **require** the user to select the virtual machine you wish to convert and all of them should be set to the same instance.

5. In Step 2 validate your inputs and select the deploy blueprint button.

6. Validate the Job completes in the queue

  After creating a VM for management or after deploying the blueprint to convert an existing VM to a managed one, the VM will be 'Under Construction' while background processes are completed. You will not have access to the server during that time. Please allow up to a 60 minutes. If there are any issues beyond that time, contact us via email <a href="mailto:request@centurylink.com">request@centurylink.com</a> or by phone at the following numbers.

    * In the US: 888.638.6771
    * UK: +44.118.322.6100
    * Singapore: +65.6305.8099.

  Please do not email the CenturyLink Cloud NOC or raise the issue via chat - faster responses to inquiries will come from the email address and support numbers above. This is because Managed support is provided by a different team than Platform support.

### Validation
The user will receive a notification email once the virtual machine is successfully converted to Managed.
```
Your request "Managed server build VA1CCVARHEL01" has successfully completed.
```

Validation can also be confirmed by looking for an asterisk (*) next to the name of the server in the Control Portal.
