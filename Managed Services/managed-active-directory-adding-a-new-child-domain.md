<p>As your Active Directory environment grows, you may need add new "child" domains. <p><strong>NOTE: Before you can deploy a new child domain, you must have Managed Active Directory and Managed Windows server in place. <strong>Also, please ensure that two or more Domain Controllers have been built in your deployment, as this is a necessary component for servers to be added into your Domain. If this is not possible, all server builds will be added into the shared Active Directory Domain.</strong></strong>
