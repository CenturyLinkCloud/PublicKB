### Overview

Lumen takes over these responsibilities and delivers end-to-end services. Unlike other DRaaS solutions, Lumen MDRS carries out regular audits, tests, and at-time-of-disaster (ATOD) failover services to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of your DR solution. MDRS services including:

* White-glove on boarding
* 24x7 monitoring and maintenance
* Semi-annual testing
* Quarterly audits
* ATOD failover services
* Runbook automation and maintenance
* Application recovery services
