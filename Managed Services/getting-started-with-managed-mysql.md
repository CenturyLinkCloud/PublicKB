<p>MySQL&nbsp;is an open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL).</p>
<p>Here's how to create a managed MySQL environment in CenturyLink Cloud.</p>

**NOTE**: Before you can deploy Managed MySQL, you must create a Managed Red Hat server.</strong></strong>

<p><strong>1. Log on to the [Control Portal](https://control.ctl.io/). Using the left side navigation bar, click on **Orchestration** > **Blueprints Library**. Search for the "MySQL" in the Blueprint library. Then, click on the “CLC Managed Oracle MySQL Enterprise” Blueprint. After that, click on the **deploy blueprint** button.
