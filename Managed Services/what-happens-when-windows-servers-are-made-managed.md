### Overview
This document provides an overview of steps taken when Windows servers are prepared to be managed by CenturyLink.

### Audience

Users employed by companies that have agreed to terms with [CenturyLink Sales](http://www.centurylink.com/) for the CenturyLink Cloud product.

### Prerequisites
* An understanding of the process for [making newly created servers managed](../Managed Services/created-a-managed-server-now-what.md) or for [converting pre-existing servers to managed](../Managed Services/converting-unmanaged-virtual-machines-to-managed.md)

* Some idea of the benefits included with [managed servers](../Managed Services/managed-operating-system-frequently-asked-questions.md)

* Grasp of Windows Server fundamentals

### Important Information

It is required that a Windows server reboot during the make managed process. If the server already exists and is being [converted](../Managed Services/converting-unmanaged-virtual-machines-to-managed.md) then the server should be placed in maintenance mode prior to running the blueprint and removed from maintenance mode once an email verifying completion has been received.

The following is not meant to be a complete description of everything that happens when a VM is prepared for management, but to give users a better idea of configuration changes that might be necessary to manage their servers.

Many of the following items are mandatory. Some default items have options for change. If you would like to alter default options, please contact the CenturyLink Client Service Center at 1-888-638-6771 to submit your request for review.

* A client is downloaded onto the VM. This client allows for installation of management tools, configuration, and remote support.
* If a [dedicated domain exists](../Managed Services/getting-started-with-managed-active-directory.md) for the customer, the server will be joined to it. Otherwise, the server will join a shared domain.
* Our monitoring agent is installed and configured. Heartbeat monitoring of the agent commences.
* Our approved virus scanning agent is downloaded and configured. It will be updated weekly.
* 10 GB D: drive is added. If D: drive already exists, the next available, unused drive will be added.
* A pre-defined Windows Update Group Policy Object is linked to each customer OU. Miscrosoft-approved patches will be applied  [If the server already exists ](../Managed Services/converting-unmanaged-virtual-machines-to-managed.md) there is an exception. No updates will be applied to Customer Provided Images (CPI). [requests can be made](../Managed Services/created-a-managed-server-now-what.md) to approve or un-approve particular patches.
