<p>Centurylink Cloud SSL certificates provide website information security. SSL certificates address the core requirements for effectively securing the communication between a web server and the customers interacting through it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here's how to procure a managed SSL certificate in CenturyLink Cloud. <strong>NOTE: Before you can acquire a Managed SSL certificate, you must create a sever with a Managed OS, either Managed Windows or Managed Red Hat.</strong>

<p><strong>1. Log on to the [Control Portal](https://control.ctl.io/). Using the left side navigation bar, click on **Orchestration** > **Blueprints Library**. Search for SSL in the Refine Results. Then, choose the right SSL Cert based on your preference, either Windows or Linux.</strong>
