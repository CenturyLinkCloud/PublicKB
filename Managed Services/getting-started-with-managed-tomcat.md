<p>Apache Tomcat is an open source software implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies. As a collaboration of best-of-breed developers from around the world, Apache Tomcat has rapidly become one of the leading Web servers. Here's

<p><strong>3. Fill out the appropriate details for the CLC Managed Apache Tomcat Blueprint.</strong>

<p>Ensure that the appropriate services that are included within Apache Tomcat are installed i.e., Tomcat v7, Tomcat v8 or Tomcat v8.5</p>
