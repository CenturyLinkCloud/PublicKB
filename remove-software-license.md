### Description (goal/purpose)

1. Software installed via blueprint is not functioning correctly but a license charge for the software has been applied to the server. 
2. Blueprint did not install software but the license charge was still applied to the server.

### Audience

- Customers with improper charges for software on a server</li>

### Steps

1. If the Blueprint failed to install the software due to an issue with a missing prerequisite (not enough disk space, etc) we recommend that correct the condition that resulted in the failure and attempt to re-run the Blueprint to install the desired software.

2. On machines where troubleshooting attempts have failed or where the software was successfully installed but you wish to remove it the only way to remove the charge for any licenses billed by our Control site is to delete the machine they are associated with. The reason for this policy is based on wording in the license agreements for much of the Software that is made available for installation via Blueprints. Due to this our support staff will be unable to assist in removing these charges from a machine.

If you were charged for software that you were unable to use due to installation failure you may request credit for the current months license cost for that software.
