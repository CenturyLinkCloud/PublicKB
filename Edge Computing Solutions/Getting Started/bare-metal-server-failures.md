### Description

What happens when your Lumen Edge Bare Metal server has physical failures?

Lumen Technologies is responsible for all hardware replacement for Bare Metal servers.  
In the event you experience a failed component, dead server, or issue’s logging into your Edge Bare Metal server, our Customer Care team is ready to assist 24/7.
Due to the low-level ownership of hardware by customers, Lumen has limited insight to hardware level failures. In the event a failure is detected by Lumen operations, they will reach out to coordinate maintenance.

If you’re having component level failures (eg. Disk, memory dim, NIC port, etc.) or full failure with your Lumen Edge Bare Metal server, Lumen Customer Care team is on call 24/7 to assist. Below are some common scenarios and our recommended actions.

**Support does not include OS level issues and the Customer Care team will not be able to assist.  

**Failed Components**

•	Disk – If one or more disks have failed.
•	Memory DIMM – If you’re seeing DIMM errors or not seeing the expected quantity of RAM.
•	NIC or Port: failure of NIC or a port on NIC.
•	Power Supply

**Resolution of Failed Components**

One of our technicians will be happy to assist.
You will need to provide the server name and your Tenant (Account) name when reaching out to Customer Care.

**Full Failure**

In the event your server is effectively dead, unable to ping, unable to perform power operations or fails on boot.

**Resolution of Full Failure**

Please contact Customer Care.

•	If there’s no data that needs to be recovered, we recommend decommissioning the server by initiating a “Delete” in the Actions menu in the Hosts view or Host detailed views in the portal and provision a new bare metal server to replace the failed server.
