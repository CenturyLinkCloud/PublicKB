### Audience & Prerequisites

2. User must know their Control Center account credentials. You can find help regarding control center credentials [here](https://www.lumen.com/help/en-us/control-center/general/retrieving-your-username-or-password.html).

**Existing Lumen Customer without a Control Center account**

If you are an existing Lumen customer but do not have a [Control Center account](https://www.lumen.com/help/en-us/control-center.html), you can create a Control Center account [here](https://controlcenter.lumen.com/business/prelogin/#/self-registration).

Existing Lumen Customers can also reach out to their account manager for further assistance with this process.
