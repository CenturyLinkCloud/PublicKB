### Description

This article will outline the User Management and Entitlement functionality that is natively available within the Edge Orchestrator Portal.
The Edge Orchestrator Portal provides multiple user management and role based access control capabilities.
These roles can be managed within the **Admin -> Roles** section of the Edge Orchestrator Portal.
They are designed to be robust enough to fit within a wide array of enterprise and managed service provider scenarios.

**Note** Not all of the User Management options or functions listed below may be available at this time. The list below is a complete list of all of the functionality we will be releasing over time.
As the Edge Orchestrator platform evolves, more features, infrastructure and compute options, functionality, and integrations will be available for Edge customers to consume, thus expanding the Management functionality.
Lumen plans to rapidly add features to the Edge Orchestrator platform.

### Roles

There are two types of roles within the Edge Orchestrator Portal.

1. Tenant
2. User based roles

Both sets of roles allow restrictions to be imposed on a user at the feature access level.
Entire sections within the appliance UI can be hidden based on the specified access levels for features within the portal.
Features have different access scopes that can be selected from and can range depending on the specific feature.
The most common scope set involves none, read, and full.
Instance Type access is also common among both role types which allow the administrator to restrict which service catalog items they are allowed to provision within the portal.

There are several handy tricks for creating new roles within the portal and users can be assigned more than one role.
When a user is assigned more than one role, permissions are granted by the role with the highest level of scope access.
This allows roles to be built with small subsets of features and combined to grant different individuals relevant permission control.


## Tenant Roles

A Tenant based role is used to ensure access control enforcement across an entire tenant with many sub-users.
This allows the subtenant to manage their own set of internal user based roles without worrying master tenant involvement in setting them up.
The master tenant is the only tenant able to create and manage these types of roles. When editing a Tenant, a singular tenant role can be assigned to the account.
Users within the tenant can be assigned roles but those user based roles will never be able to supersede the level of access granted by the tenant role.
This allows a super administrator the ability to restrict access at the department or organization level without having to worry about per user access control within said tenant.

Tenant roles also have an additional section not in User based roles related to Cloud Access. Cloud Access allows the master tenant the ability to assign cloud integration resources to specific subtenants or groups of subtenants. An example would be granting access to a specific VMware cluster only to a subset of tenants using the tenant based role control.

## User Roles

User roles can be created by any tenant given permission at the tenant role level.
These allow tenants to manage their own sets of users and their levels of access.
They also allow tenants to control which users have access to specific “Groups” for provisioning into within the portal.
Groups are not cross tenant and therefore need to be controlled within the individual tenant.

Master tenants are able to create a special type of user role called a multi-tenant user role. A multi-tenant user role is copied / duplicated down to all subtenants.
These can be viewed as pre-canned role templates available to new tenants when their account is first created.
Any changes made to the main role are propagated down to the subtenants version of the shared role so long as the subtenant has not previously adjusted/changed that role.
The moment a subtenant makes adjustments to the shared role within their account, it is unlinked from the parent role and treated entirely independently.

When a user role is copied down to a subtenant, the permission scopes cannot supersede the tenants assigned tenant role.
If they do they are automatically downgraded when propagated to the specific tenant.
Any changes made to the tenant role will automatically ensure roles within the tenant are downgraded appropriately.

## Multi-Tenant User Role Lock

As discussed above, multi-tenanted user roles are made available within all subtenants as ‘canned’ user role sets. Master tenant administrators can prevent changes to these ‘canned’ user roles by marking the box labeled ‘Multitenant LOCKED’ when creating or editing the role. In addition to preventing subtenant administrators from modifying permissions of these roles within their subtenancy, this option also ensures master tenant administrators can propagate new changes to that role. Modification of the role by the subtenant (if allowed) breaks the link back to the master tenant and the copy of the role within the subtenant will become its own unlinked role.

**Note** Multi-tenant role lock applies only to permission sets on the ‘FEATURE ACCESS’ tab.
Permissions in the ‘GROUP ACCESS’, ‘INSTANCE TYPE ACCESS’, and ‘BLUEPRINT ACCESS’ tabs are not locked.
Similarly, changes made to the role on these tabs in the master tenant are not synced down.

## Roles and Identity Sources

It is very common for large Enterprises to have an existing identity source that they would like to plug into the Edge Orchestrator Portal for authentication.
This includes services like LDAP, Active Directory, OKTA, Jump Cloud, One Login, and SAML.
When using these services it becomes important to configure a role mapping between the portal role assignments to the equivalent identity source groups/roles the user belongs to.
This is configurable within the identity source management UI.
Sections are provided allowing things like LDAP groups to be directly mapped to specific roles within the portal.
If a user matches more than one LDAP/role group then both sets of roles are applied to the user automatically.

Configuring Identity Sources is done in Tenant management or user management in **Administration > Tenants or Administration > Users**, and has to be configured on a per-tenant basis.
Additionally, administrators may opt to lock users to their mapped role or keep the roles unlocked to manually administer roles in one-off scenarios.

### Role Permissions

Permission options for sub-tenant user roles will only list options permitted by the Tenant role applied to the sub-tenant. Sub-Tenant user roles permissions cannot exceed permissions set by the overriding Tenant Role.

### User Role Permission Sections

**FEATURE ACCESS**
Controls User access level for UI sections and features in the portal.
As the Edge Orchestrator portal

**GROUP ACCESS**
Controls User access level for Groups. Groups are not a Multi-Tenant construct, only Groups created in the current Tenant will be visible.

**INSTANCE TYPE ACCESS**
Controls User access level for Instance Types. Only Instance Types created in the current Tenant or those created in the Master Tenant and shared with the current Tenant will be available.

**BLUEPRINT ACCESS**
Controls User access level for Blueprints during App provisioning. Only Blueprints created in the current Tenant or those created in the Master Tenant and shared with the current Tenant will be available.

**PERSONAS**
Controls User access to Edge Orchestrator portal Personas, at the time of this writing Users may be given access to the Standard (full the portal experience) or Service Catalog Personas

**CATALOG ITEM TYPES**
Controls User access to Catalog Item types within the Service Catalog Persona. Only Catalog Items created in the current Tenant or those created in the Master Tenant and shared with the current Tenant will be available.

### Tenant Role Permission Sections

**FEATURE ACCESS**
Controls Tenant access level for sections and features in the portal. The complete feature permissions grid is included below.

**CLOUD ACCESS**
Controls Tenant access level for Clouds. This list includes Clouds integrated from the Master Tenant and shared publicly. Tenants given this Tenant Role will have either Full, Read, or None access levels to a given Cloud. See the section below for more information on Cloud Access levels.

**INSTANCE TYPE ACCESS**
Controls Tenant access level for Instance Types. Only Instance Types created in the current Tenant or those created in the Master Tenant and shared with the current Tenant will be available.

**BLUEPRINT ACCESS**
Controls Tenant access level for Blueprints during App provisioning. Only Blueprints created in the current Tenant or those created in the Master Tenant and shared with the current Tenant will be available.

**CATALOG ITEM TYPES**
Controls Tenant access to Catalog Item types within the Service Catalog Persona. Only Catalog Items created in the current Tenant or those created in the Master Tenant and shared with the current Tenant will be available.

**Cloud Access Levels**
When creating or editing a Tenant Role, Master Tenant administrators can choose which publicly-visible Clouds to share with Tenants having the current Role. Access can be completely restricted or administrators can choose between Read and Full access.

**Read Access**
Master Tenant administrators can opt to give other Tenants read-level access to any integrated Clouds through the Tenant Role. A read-only Cloud allows the Master Tenant to assign resources for viewing by Subtenant users but not allow them to perform any actions or provision new Instances.

With read-level access, Subtenant users will have access to the Cloud detail page (Infrastructure > Clouds).
From the Summary subtab on the Cloud detail page, high-level information on Cloud resources are shown regardless of specific resources that have been shared with the Subtenant.
Other metrics, such as costing, resource percentages (CPU, Memory, and Storage), VM counts and host counts will only be populated when servers in the Cloud have been assigned to the Tenant.

**Full Access**
With full access, Subtenant users also have access to the Cloud detail page (Infrastructure > Clouds > Specific Cloud) and see the same level of detail as Subtenants with read-only rights. However, with full access, Subtenant users can also perform many actions including the addition of Clusters, Hosts, and VMs, changing networks, and more. This cloud will also be selectable as a provisioning target for Subtenant users when deploying Instances or Apps.

### Feature Access Permissions

Feature Access settings control permissions for sections and objects in the portal.

Permission options include:

**None**
Hidden or inaccessible for user

**Read**
User can view but cannot edit or create

**Full**

### Creating Roles

User Roles
User Roles can be single or Multitenant.
A Multitenant User Role is automatically copied into all existing subtenants as well as placed into a subtenant when created. Useful for providing a set of predefined roles a Customer can use. The Multitenant Locked option prevent subtenant from modifying FEATURE ACCESS settings in the Role. Note Group, Instance Type and Blueprint Access settings will still be editable as Groups are unique per Tenant, and Instance and Blueprints can be a mix of unique and shared items.

**Important**

Multitenant Roles still need to be configured/managed be each subtenant, as Groups are unique per Tenant, and Instance and Blueprints can be a mix of unique and shared items.

*Note
User Roles cannot exceed Tenant Role permissions. If a Multitenant User Role has higher permissions than the Tenant Role assigned to a subtenant, the Multitenant User Role permissions in that Tenant will automatically be reduced to match the Tenant Role permissions.
