CenturyLink Cloud customers may wish to add a public IP to a specific [virtual machine](//www.ctl.io/servers/) or [Bare Metal](//www.ctl.io/bare-metal/) server in their cloud environment to deliver services. Public IPs are delivered using a 1 to 1 NAT model.

### General Notes & Best Practices

* All public IPs deployed on the platform have [hairpinning](../Network/hairpin-nats.md) enabled.
* In its current iteration setting a source IP filter will secure all public ports, single ports or port ranges specified by the customer. Customers can leverage OS based [firewall services](//www.ctl.io/cloud-firewall/) if they wish to secure public services in a more granular fashion.
* Customers are encouraged to leverage the source IP filter unless delivering completely open public Internet services to their user community.
* Customers should avoid opening RDP or SSH to their virtual machines to the public Internet. As such the following are recommended access methods.
 * Use the free OpenVPN client included in every CenturyLink Cloud Account. Refer to [How To Configure Client VPN](../Network/how-to-configure-client-vpn.md). This is the ideal solution for individuals who are mobile and not in fixed office or data center locations.
 * Build an IPSEC VPN Tunnel from a remote office or data center location. Refer to [Creating a Self-Service IPSEC Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel](../Network/creating-a-self-service-ipsec-site-to-site-vpn-tunnel.md). IPSEC VPN tunnels are best for remote access to Cloud Virtual Machines when administrators are in centralized offices or data centers.
 * If either of the previous options are not feasible customers should at a minimum use the source IP filter service on the public IP and pair that with local OS firewall policies within the guest VM.
 * Refer to [How to Add Public IP to servers](../Network/how-to-add-public-ip-to-virtual-machine.md), for further instructions.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What happens to my Public IP if I use the pause, power off or archive services in CenturyLink Cloud?**

A: Public IP addresses are static and using any of these features does not remove the public IP services from the server. The only time a public IP is removed from a server is a) when the server is deleted b) the customer removes the public IP in the GUI or API

**Q: How are customers billed for public IP addresses?**

A: Customers are billed a nominal fee per public IP on a monthly basis. Public IPs are not an hourly billing service and as such using a public IP even for an hour will result in a nominal charge for the public IP address.

**Q: What is the maximum number of Public IPs that can be bound to a server?**

A: As the platform uses a 1 to 1 NAT (public to private) and /24 network sizes the current maximum number of public IPs is 219 per VM. Bare Metal servers are only permitted a single public IP currently.

**Q: Who do I contact for support or questions regarding Public IP listings?**

A: For service issues [please contact support.](../Support/how-do-i-report-a-support-issue.md)
