<p>There are several "different" OpenVPN products available. Some of them use completely free open source libraries and other do use some commercial libraries. CenturyLink Cloud uses software under this license:</p>
<p><a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/license.html">http://openvpn.net/index.php/license.html</a>
</p>
<p>What is not free for commercial use is the OpenVPN Access Server. That software contains a GUI for managing connections, creating VPN download bundles, etc. CenturyLink Cloud does not use this software, allowing everyone to be covered under the community
  supported edition. A comparison of the editions can be found here.</p>
