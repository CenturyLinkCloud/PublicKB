<p>There are several "different" OpenVPN products available. Some of them use completely free open source libraries and other do use some commercial libraries. CenturyLink Cloud uses software under this license:</p>
<p><a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/license.html">http://openvpn.net/index.php/license.html</a>
</p>
<p>What is not free for commercial use is the OpenVPN Access Server. That software contains a GUI for managing connections, creating VPN download bundles, etc. CenturyLink Cloud does not use this software, allowing everyone to be covered under the community
  supported edition. Information about license questions can be found here.</p>
