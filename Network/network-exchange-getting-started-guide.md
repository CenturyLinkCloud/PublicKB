### Product Overview

[Network Exchange](https://www.ctl.io/network-exchange/) provides secure, high-speed, redundant, automated network connections between disparate IT environments allowing for a true hybrid environment. Common environments include CenturyLink Cloud (CLC), CenturyLink Private Cloud on VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), Colocation environments, CenturyLink Managed Hosting, CenturyLink Dedicated Cloud Compute, 3rd party networks and customer owned devices. Network Exchange is ideal for your hybrid environment as well as capacity augmentation or cloud bursting, data migration, and disaster recovery. 

An instance of Network Exchange is referred to as an Exchange. An Exchange is an interconnect between two or more IT environments. A Network Exchange customer may have one or more Exchanges. A connectivity point, such as a Colocation, in an Exchange is referred to as an Endpoint.

Network Exchange is offered in a fixed monthly billing model preventing customers from experiencing unexpected charges. Please refer to the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Billing Guide ](network-exchange-billing-guide.md) for details on how billing is calculated.

**Note:** Redundancy to all Endpoint types are supported in Network Exchange. Non-redundant connectivity is also available for Colocation environments or Endpoints required Dedicated Access.

### Prerequisites

* You must be logged in to perform the functions outlined in this guide.
* The desired Endpoint should be verified as supported at the desired data center(s). Please refer to the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Availability Matrix](network-exchange-connectivity-matrix-configuration-guide.md).
* The desired Endpoint / data center combination(s) per Exchange should be validated as a supported configuration in the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Availability Guide](network-exchange-connectivity-matrix-configuration-guide.md) once Endpoint availability has been validated, per the previous step.
* Each Endpoint type has certain prerequisites, capabilities and caveats that should be understood before setting up an Exchange. Please see the following Knowledge Base documents for details:

### Q & A

**Q: How many Exchanges may an End User have?**

**A:** There are currently no limitations on the number of Exchanges per End User. See the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Configuration Guide](network-exchange-connectivity-matrix-configuration-guide.md) for more details.

**Q: How many endpoints may be in an Exchange?**

**A:** An Exchange may include a number of endpoints up to the maximum Exchange Port
types available in a metro area served by Network Exchange. See the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Configuration Guide](network-exchange-connectivity-matrix-configuration-guide.md) for more details.

**Q: How do I convert from Cloud Network Service to Network Exchange?**

**A:** A Knowledge Base article Migrating from Cloud Network Service to Network Exchange will be provided in the future that will discuss this in detail.

**Q: Can I change the name of an Exchange once it’s created.**

**A:** No. You will have to delete and recreate the Exchange with the name of your choice.

**Q: How do I know when I can use an Exchange?**

**A:** Exchanges will pass traffic any time it has an “ACTIVE” status. Note that for
colocation and direct connect endpoints, cross connects must be in place and the destination networks including the connectivity endpoints must be configured correctly
for traffic to pass.

**Q: Who should I contact for Support?**

**A:** Support requests should be emailed to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io).
