Add a User Friendly Name to VLANs
<p>Lumen Cloud customers may wish to provide a friendly name to the VLAN(s) in their account. Now available globally, this feature&nbsp;makes it easy to identify the role of that specific network in the overall Cloud topology.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>Lumen Cloud Control Portal Administrators.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A Lumen Cloud Account</li>
  <li>Account Admin Permissions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Detailed Steps</h3>
<p>1. Navigate to Networks and select the existing VLAN you wish to add a friendly name.</p>
</p>
<p>2. Select the edit button</p>
</p>
<p>3. Input a new friendly name and description for the VLAN</p>
</p>
<p>   Alternatively, you can input a new friendly name with the subnet included.  This allows you to see the subnet on the "create server" page as the description will not be viewable there.</p>
