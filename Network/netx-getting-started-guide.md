### Product Overview

[Network Exchange](//www.ctl.io/network-exchange/) ("NetX") provides secure, reliable, automated interconnectivity between service networks offered by NetX Providers, including managed hosting, colocation and cloud environments. A NetX Provider is any service provider who has integrated their networking domain for interconnect provisioning by NetX. A NetX User is any credentialed users of NetX who has Provider-defined access privileges to two or more NetX Providers. This is the party who ultimately consumes Network Exchange, regardless of the Provider with which they have a direct contractual relationship. An instance of Network Exchange is itself referred to as an Exchange. It is an interconnect between two or more NetX Providers. A NetX User may have one or more Exchanges. A connectivity point for a NetX Provider for a given Exchange is referred to as an Exchange Port. For example, "Colocation" is a type of Exchange Port.

Network Exchange is offered in a pay-as-you-go billing model in which the NetX User pays only for the bandwidth they consume for billable Exchange Port types. Please refer to the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Availability Matrix]() for details on how billing is calculated.

**Note:** All equipment and connectivity is redundant in Network Exchange, including cross connects to colocation and direct connect endpoint types. Non-redundant connectivity is not supported.

### Glossary

* **Network Exchange (NetX):** Provides secure, reliable, automated interconnectivity between service networks within a metro-area computing environment.
  * **NetX Provider:** Any service provider who has integrated their networking domain for interconnect NetX.  
    This integration comes in two common sub-types:
    * Software Defined Integration: Dynamic allocation of networks, IPs and
routing by an API-driven resource model
    * Configured Integration: Automated allocation of networks, IPs and routing by Provider-defined manual entry for which the Provider is responsible
  * **NetX User:** Any credentialed users of NetX who has Provider-defined access privileges to two or more NetX Providers.  This is the party who ultimately consumes Network Exchange, regardless of the Provider with which they have a direct contractual relationship.
    * **Exchange:** An interconnect between two or more NetX Providers. A NetX User may have one or more Exchanges.
    * **Exchange Port:** The connectivity point for a NetX Provider for a given Exchange.

* Common Provider business models include:
  * **Hosted Service Provider:** Primarily provides SaaS or managed services on infrastructure hosted by CenturyLink o External Managed Service Provider: Primarily provides services to others on infrastructure not operated by CTL, i.e. IaaS clouds, SaaS platforms, Colocation providers.
  * **External Network Service Provider:** Primarily provides WAN services, e.g. Level3, Comcast.
  * **CenturyLink Managed Service Provider:** Any CTL-provided service, e.g. CLC, DCC, Managed Hosting, NetX o CenturyLink Managed Network Provider: Any CTL-provided network, e.g. IQ, CTL-SDWAN
* **On-Net Provider:** A service provider, fitting any of the above sub-models, who is directly or indirectly reachable via Network Exchange (NetX)
* **On-Net Traffic:** Network traffic that leaves NetX to a CenturyLink Managed Service Provider, CenturyLink Managed Network Provider or Hosted Service Provider
* **Egress Traffic:** Network traffic that leaves NetX to an External Managed Service Provider or External Network Service Provider
* **Network Exchange (NetX) Reseller:** A Provider who also offers white-labeled Network Exchange interconnectivity, providing their customers access to all On-Net Providers.

### Prerequisites

* You must be logged in to perform the functions outlined in this guide.
* The desired Exchange Port type should be verified as supported at the desired data center(s). Please refer to the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Availability Matrix]().
* The desired Exchange Ports / data center combination(s) per Exchange should be
validated as a supported configuration in the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Valid Exchange Configurations]() once Exchange Port availability has been validated, per the previous step.
* Each Exchange Port type has certain prerequisites, capabilities and caveats that should be understood before setting up an Exchange. Please see the following Knowledge Base documents for details:
* [Network Exchange CenturyLink Cloud Exchange Ports]()
* [Network Exchange Managed Hosting Exchange Ports]()
* [Network Exchange Colocation Exchange Ports]()
* [Network Exchange Dedicated Access Exchange Ports]()

### Exceptions

Network Exchange is designed to enable connectivity between any supported Exchange Port type in any supported data center. Under certain circumstances, not all supported Exchange Port types will be available at every supported data center. Any exceptions to this general rule will be noted in the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Valid Exchange Configurations]() in the addendum. Retirement of known exceptions will be published in the [CenturyLink Cloud release notes](//www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/release-notes/2017/#1).

![NetX Portal](../../images/netx-getting-started-guide-2.png)

On the Network Exchange **Create an Exchange** screen, in the **Name Your
Exchange** dialogue box:

1. In the top-left corner of the screen, select the (sub)account to be used for this Exchange.

2. Enter the **Exchange Name**. This name be appended with a randomly generated
number to create a unique identifier for this Exchange. Note that this field may not contain spaces.

3. Enter the **Description**. This free form text is used to describe the Exchange you are
creating. This field should be utilized to differentiate amongst Exchanges.

4. Only usage-based billing is available at this time and therefore no selection is required for **Billing Type**.

    **Note:** “Account Alias” is a four character ID that will be auto-populated after the first step, and thus does not need to be manually entered.

    **Note:** CenturyLink Service Delivery teams acting on behalf of a customer should enter the customer’s Account Alias here.

5. Click **Next**.

On the Network Exchange **Select Feature for Endpoint 1** screen, in the **Name Your
Exchange** dialogue box:

2. Click **Next**.

Follow the instructions for the selected endpoint type from the options, below. You may add endpoints in any order and in any combination per supported configurations. The desired Exchange Ports / data center combination(s) per Exchange should be validated as a supported configuration in the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Valid Exchange Configurations]().

### Q & A

**Q: How many Exchanges may an End User have?**

**A:** There are currently no limitations on the number of Exchanges per End User. See the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Valid Exchange Configurations]() for more details.

**Q: How many endpoints may be in an Exchange?**

**A:** An Exchange may include a number of endpoints up to the maximum Exchange Port
types available in a metro area served by Network Exchange. See the Knowledge Base article [Network Exchange Valid Exchange Configurations]() for more details.

**Q: How do I convert from Cloud Network Service to Network Exchange?**

**A:** A Knowledge Base article [Migrating from Cloud Network Service to Network Exchange]() will be provided in the future that will discuss this in detail.

**Q: Can I change the name of an Exchange once it’s created.**

**A:** No. You will have to delete and recreate the Exchange with the name of your choice.

**Q: How do I know when I can use an Exchange?**

**A:** Exchanges will pass traffic any time it has an “ACTIVE” status. Note that for
colocation and direct connect endpoints, cross connects must be in place and the destination networks including the connectivity endpoints must be configured correctly
for traffic to pass.

**Q: Who should I contact for Support?**

**A:** Support requests should be emailed to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io).
