### Product Overview

[Network Exchange](//www.ctl.io/network-exchange/) provides a secure, high speed, redundant, private network to connect your CenturyLink Cloud environment to other environments.  It is the preferred alternative to using the Internet or IPSec for customers needing to connect their CLC environments to other, non-CLC environments.  Network Exchange is ideal for your hybrid environment and applications as well as storage and backups.  Network Exchange includes ease of setup and management via the CLC Portal, coupled with CLC network automation, and pre-deployed network infrastructure.  All with usage based, pay as you go billing.

### Prerequisites

•	Access to the CenturyLink Cloud Portal as an authorized user
•	CenturyLink Cloud customer environment at UC1
•	A CNS (Cloud Network Service) connection to your DCC (Dedicated Cloud Compute) environment
•	The network VLANs of the CenturyLink Managed Hosting endpoint

### Exceptions

Although CenturyLink Cloud Network Exchange is designed to provide connectivity between the CLC Platform and other platforms, not all platforms and all locations are tested and ready at this time.  Availability is noted in the Prerequisite section above.  Refer to this document, the location and endpoints document, and the CLC release notes for updates to Network Exchange.
