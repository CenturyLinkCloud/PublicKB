* Network Exchange Pricing
* Network Exchange Invoicing

### Monthly Fixed Rate Billing

The monthly fixed rate billing model means that Network Exchange users pay a set price regardless of the bandwidth consumed during the use of the Network Exchange service. This billing model allows customers to know exactly how much they will be billed through the entire term of the contract or monthly for month-to-month customers.

### How Billing is Calculated

Prices are based on the following parameters:
1) Endpoint type
2) Rate Limit
3) Redundancy, and
4) for CenturyLink Cloud, location

* Discounts are given for contract terms of 1, 2, and 3 years. Additional discounts may be granted based on total CenturyLink product purchases. 

### Network Exchange Pricing

Network Exchange Endpoint pricing can be viewed in the [CenturyLink Cloud Pricing page](https://www.ctl.io/pricing). Pricing for multiple Endpoints can be determined using the [CenturyLink Cloud Price Estimator](https://www.ctl.io/estimator/).

### Network Exchange Invoicing

Network Exchange charges will appear as sub-line items within the end userâ€™s CenturyLink Cloud charges. Managed Hosting and Colocation charges will appear on separate invoices.
