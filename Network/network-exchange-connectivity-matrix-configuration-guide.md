### Configuration Guide

* Only Endpoints in the same metro are allowed within an Exchange.
* There may be multiple instances of an Endpoint type per Exchange except for CenturyLink Cloud. A user may have multiple Exchanges in the same location.
* There can only be one CenturyLink Cloud (CLC) Endpoint per account alias, per data center, no matter the number of Exchanges.
* Once bandwidth for the physical connections (cross connects) between Network Exchange and the end user network for a Colocation/Dedicated Access Endpoint has been established, it cannot be modified without a scheduled service change. Bandwidth over connections is not determined by Network Exchange, but rather, by the physical medium chosen.

For more information, please see the [Network Exchange Product page](https://www.ctl.io/network-exchange/) or the [Network Exchange FAQ](../Network/network-exchange-faqs.md) page. For guidance on creating your first Exchange, see the [Network Exchange Getting Started Guide](../Network/network-exchange-getting-started-guide.md).
