In this article we provide detailed steps to finalize routing changes inside the various operating environments supported inside CenturyLink Cloud, as well as instructions to remove unwanted interfaces as necessary.

This article assumes the user has some familiarity with the operating system they are running, as well as the [Go CLI](//github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/clc-go-cli) interface.
