### Feature Request Process

We encourage feedback and feature requests. Features are continuously being prioritized, developed and released. Features range from significant enhancements such as automated, near-real time connections to additional Cloud Service Providers to minor features such as adding more informational fields in the Network Exchange portal.

Feature Requests can be submitted through email. The full process is documented in the following Knowledge Base article [How do I submit a Feature Request?](../Support/how-do-i-submit-a-feature-request.md)
