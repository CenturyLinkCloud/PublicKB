<sup>1: Control Integration at a minimum allows a customer to implement the service on-demand, operate it via self-service in the UX (or using API) with a pay as you go model.</sup>

<sup>2: [SLA](//www.ctl.io/legal/sla/) is defined as an agreement between CenturyLink and the customer to honor service availability for load balancing specific services via a master service agreement. [Limited SLA's include Virtual Machine availability only.](//www.ctl.io/legal/sla/)</sup>

<sup>3: [Support](//www.ctl.io/support/) is defined as an agreement between CenturyLink and the customer to provide technical support and incident management for the load balancing service. Tracking a Dedicated Load Balancer license expiration date is performed by the customer, please reference our [License Management Article](../Network/dedicated-load-balancer-license-management.md). **Limited Support provides customer service engineers to confirm the infrastructure state and virtual machine state.  Customers are responsible for all Day 1, 2 and N operational support.**</sup>

<sup>4: [CenturyLink offers](//www.ctl.io/pricing/) various pricing models for the Citrix VPX virtual appliance based on performance and availability needs.  Customers can elect to upgrade **[edition](//www.citrix.com/products/netscaler-adc/platforms.html#editions)** and **availability** configurations at any time.</sup>

<sup>5: Layer 4 is related to fourth layer of the OSI model: transport level. For example: TCP and UDP protocols are transport level. Layer 7 is related to seventh layer of the OSI model: application level. For example: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS protocols are application level.</sup>

<sup>6: All algorithms support "weight" concept. The "weight" parameter is used to adjust the server's weight relative to other servers. All servers will receive a load proportional to their weight relative to the sum of all weights, so the higher the weight, the higher the load.</sup>

<sup>7: CenturyLink provides lifecycle management based on Day 0 (Install: Import, IP Device), 1 (Configure, Operate), 2 (Optimize, Compliance) and N (Upgrade, Patching) methodologies.  Customers are responsible for any operational support that is not included in the base offering.</sup>
