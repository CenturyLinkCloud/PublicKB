  <ul>
    <li>Shared Load Balancers are now <a href="creating-a-self-service-load-balancing-configuration.md">configurable in a self-service fashion</a>.</li>
    <li>Customers can log in directly to their Dedicated Load Balancers.</li>
    <li>With the Shared Load Balancers the External IP sits directly on the Load Balancer.</li>
    <li>With a Dedicated Load Balancer, the VIP is an internal IP. In order to provide external access, a MIP/NAT must be added to the firewall, which will point to the internal VIP.</li>
    <li>If a customer wants to use a Load Balancer to access an internal VIP over their site to site VPN they must use a dedicated Load Balancer. It is not possible to access an internal VIP on the the Shared Load Balancer over a site to site VPN.</li>
    <li>All shared Load Balancers are in a High Availability pair. If either node goes down there will be no downtime. Dedicated Load Balancers can be put in a HA pair by request.</li>
    <li>MIP's are not accessible from within the datacenter. If you need to reach a public IP from both inside and outside the datacenter, you need to use the Shared Load Balancer.</li>
