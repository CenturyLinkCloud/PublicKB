CenturyLink is dedicated to providing you with ongoing support. We embrace a strong operational philosophy that is customer focused and highly responsive.

### CDN Support Technician

Once your CenturyLink service has been installed, a CDN support technician will be your single point of contact for service-related issues. The CDN support technician is trained to quickly address technical issues related to your service. The primary objective of a CDN support technician is to provide start-to-finish accountability for network service performance and to drive the resolution of issues based on the first call.

You can reach a CDN support technician at any time. The CDN support technician will create a ticket with a reference number for tracking. Your technician will initiate a number of tests and processes to determine a fault and fix agent. The technician will either solve the problem or collaborate with internal or external fix agents until a resolution is established.
