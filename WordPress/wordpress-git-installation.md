## Overview
Git is a lightweight, opensource, version control system. Initially designed for Linux, Git has been packaged for simple implementation on most operating systems and is the software used to clone and update CenturyLink WordPress repositories.

Git 1.7.10 or newer is required for interacting with your CenturyLink WordPress repository.  There are many methods of installing Git, and many excellent Graphical User Interfaces, but these are the most basic methods to get a working copy of Git installed on the most common operating systems.
