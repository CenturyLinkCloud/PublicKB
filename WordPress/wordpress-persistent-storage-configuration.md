### IMPORTANT NOTECenturyLink Cloud WordPress hosting is currently in a Limited Beta program with specific customers by invitation only and is not intended for production usage.During the Limited Beta there is no production Service Level Agreement.## Overview

CenturyLink Cloud WordPress sites utilize Object Storage for persistent WordPress content files such as images and file attachments.  In order to utilize persistent storage you must first have a CenturyLink Cloud manually configure Centurylink Cloud Object Storage using the following link:

[Using object storage from the control portal](../Object Storage/using-object-storage-from-the-control-portal.md)

Once object storage has been configured, you must edit your base WordPress *wp-config.php* file in your [CenturyLink Git Repository](https://git.wordpress.ctl.io "CenturyLink Git") to integrate your Wordpress site with your object storage account.  

**Note: There are many methods to edit and commit this file. This knowledgebase covers editing the file in your localling cloned git repository.**

## Persistent Storage Configuration

1. [Clone your WordPress Git Repo](wordpress-clone-push-gitlab.md "Clone your WordPress Git Repo")

2. Browse to the locally cloned git repository associated with the WordPress site to be updated and open wp-config.php in a text editor.

3. Find the section of the file labeled _CenturyLink Object Storage Customer Variables_

  In this section you will see three replaceable variables:

  * customer_access_key
  * customer_secret_access_key
  * customer_bucket

  **NOTE: These are variables you will have obtained when configuring your [CenturyLink Cloud Object Storage.](../Object Storage/using-object-storage-from-the-control-portal.md)**

4. Replace the variables and save the file.

  *The following example shows the variables replaced:*

5. Inside your repo, at the command line, running `git status` will now show you uncommited changes.

6. Commit your changes using the `git add` command.

  _In this example we will run git add * to add all files to the repo_
