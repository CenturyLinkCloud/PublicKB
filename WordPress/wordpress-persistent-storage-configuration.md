### IMPORTANT NOTECenturyLink WordPress hosting is currently in a Limited Beta program with specific customers by invitation only and is not intended for production usage.During the Limited Beta there is no production Service Level Agreement.## Overview

CenturyLink WordPress hosting utilizes Object Storage for persistent storage of WordPress content files such as images and file attachments.  In order to utilize persistent storage you must manually configure a Centurylink Cloud Object Storage bucket, for use during WordPress site creation.

Instructions on creating an object storage bucket can be found on the 
[Using object storage from the control portal](../Object Storage/using-object-storage-from-the-control-portal.md) page.

Once the object storage bucket has been created, the bucket can be applied during the [creation](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/wordpress/getting-started-with-wordpress-as-a-service/) of your site.
