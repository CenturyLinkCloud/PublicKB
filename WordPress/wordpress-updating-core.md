### IMPORTANT NOTE

CenturyLink WordPress hosting is currently in a Limited Beta program with specific customers by invitation only and is not intended for production usage at this time.

During the Limited Beta there is no production Service Level Agreement.

### Overview

At the present time, CenturyLink does not provide automated updates or upgrades to WordPress sites.  This article will demonstrate the process for upgrading your site when WordPress issues a new security patch or major release.

### How to Update WordPress Core

1. Vagrant up

  First, we are going to update WordPress core in a local development environment.  If you don't already have a local copy of WordPress running on your workstation, follow the steps in this [KB article](../WordPress/wordpress-local-development.md) to set one up before continuing.

  To start up your local development environment, open up a Terminal and issue the following commands:

  `cd /path/to/your/site`

  `vagrant up`

  ![Vagrant Up](../images/wp_updating_core/wp_updating_core_1.png)

  Now, you can visit http://wp.dev to see the local copy of your WordPress site.

2. Create branch

  Next, you need to create a branch in Git for the changes we are about to make to WordPress.

  `git checkout -b update-wp-core43`

  ![git branch](../images/wp_updating_core/wp_updating_core_3.png)

3. Running the WordPress updater

  Click the _Please update now_ link in the Dashboard home page.

  ![Please update now](../images/wp_updating_core/wp_updating_core_4.png)

  In the WordPress Updates screen, click on the Update Now button.

  ![Update Now](../images/wp_updating_core/wp_updating_core_5.png)

  The update process will take a minute or two to complete.  When it is finished, you should see a screen like this:

  ![Welcome to WordPress 4.3](../images/wp_updating_core/wp_updating_core_6.png)

4. Regression test your site

  Now, you are going to want to regression test your site against the new core updates.  Take your time with this, and thoroughly test all themes and plugins that you have added to your site to ensure nothing has broken.  You may have to upgrade these to make them work with the new version of WordPress core if the author has released a new version.

  Don't continue to the next step until you are absolutely sure that everything is working correctly.

5. Stage and commit changes in Git

  Now its time to stage the core updates in Git:

    `git add .`

  And then, commit the changes:

    `git commit -m "Updated to WordPress 4.3"`

  Now, you should see the new commit in Git's log:

  ![git log](../images/wp_updating_core/wp_updating_core_7.png)

6. Merge changes into master

  Your changes have been committed, but remember you are still in a development branch.  Now, we need to merge that branch back into the master branch for your site.  Run the following commands:

  `git checkout master`

  `git merge update-wp-core43`

  `git branch -d update-wp-core43`

7. Push changes to origin/master to update site in production

  Now, push your newly updated _master_ branch to your CenturyLink git repository to update your Production site:

  `git push origin master`

8. Test and verify in PROD

  Now you can login to your production WordPress site, and verify that it was successfully updated to the new version of WordPress core.

  Occasionally, a WordPress core update may require updates to the database, and you may see a screen like this one:

  ![Database Update Required](../images/wp_updating_core/wp_updating_core_8.png)

  Go ahead and click the _Update WordPress Database_ button.

  Once the Database Update is complete, you'll see the following screen, and can click the _Continue_ button.

  ![Update Complete](../images/wp_updating_core/wp_updating_core_9.png)

  In the Dashboard Home screen, you'll find the WordPress version in the lower right corner.  Verify that it matches the core version you just updated to.
