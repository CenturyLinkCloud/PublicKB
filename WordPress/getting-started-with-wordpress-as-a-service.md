### IMPORTANT NOTE

CenturyLink WordPress hosting is currently in a Limited Beta program with specific customers by invitation only and is not intended for production usage.

During the Limited Beta there is no production Service Level Agreement.

## Overview
Today nearly 25% of the sites on the internet are WordPress sites. WordPress is an open source project that started out as just a blogging system, but is now known as a content management system that is unlimited in ways that it can be used. There is also thousands of plugins, themes and widgets that help extend and add to the functionality that already comes with WordPress.

In addition to all that WordPress has to offer, there is an extensive and helpful community of WordPress users around the world. Questions and answers can be found in [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/), [mailing lists](https://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists), [WordCamps](https://central.wordcamp.org/) and if that is not enough, thousands of video presentations exists and are being added to on [wordpress.tv](http://wordpress.tv/) to help everyone from the beginner to the expert.

CenturyLink's WordPress Hosting platform hosts secure, enterprise class, cloud-based WordPress sites.
