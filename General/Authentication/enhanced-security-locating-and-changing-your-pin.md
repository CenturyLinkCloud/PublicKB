### Description

As part of our efforts to increase the security of your accounts using the SavvisStation Portal and Private Cloud (DCC), you will need to go through a one-time setup to create a new Master Account.  You may also choose to use a Master Account to log into Cloud Application Manager.  Once setup is complete, for your security, you will receive a one-time prompt to provide credentials for your services to link them to your master account; as a result, you will be able to navigate between them without re-authenticating going forward. Other security improvements include optional multi-factor authentication through your smart phone (soft token) and the ability to set up multiple security questions for account validation and retrieval purposes.

When you engage with the customer care team, there will be times when you need to provide a PIN.  This PIN provides an additional way for the customer care team to validate who you are. This allows us the ability to better protect your account and information.  You will be required to provide a PIN whenever you attempt to make account changes or request sensitive data.  This article steps you through how you can locate your PIN.  It will also show you how can change your PIN if you would like to do so.

This article assumes that you have [created your master account](enhanced-security-master-account-registration.md) and you have [linked an account](enhanced-security-linking-and-unlinking-accounts.md).
