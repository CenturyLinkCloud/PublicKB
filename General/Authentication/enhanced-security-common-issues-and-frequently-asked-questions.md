### Description

As part of our efforts to increase the security of your accounts using the SavvisStation Portal and Private Cloud (DCC), you will need to go through a one-time setup to create a new Master Account.  You may also choose to use a Master Account to log into Cloud Application Manager. Once setup is complete, for your security, you will receive a one-time prompt to provide credentials for your services to link them to your Master Account; as a result, you will be able to navigate between them without re-authenticating going forward. Other security improvements include optional multi-factor authentication through your smart phone (soft token) and the ability to set up multiple security questions for account validation and retrieval purposes.

This article will walk you through some of the common issues, and what steps you can take to resolve them. It will also discuss how to ensure you are engaging the correct support team depending on your issue. Lastly, we will answer some of the frequently asked questions.

### Common Issues  
Registration Issues|Steps to Resolve|
:---|:---|
I cannot click next on the password creation screen.|Ensure you are creating a valid password. If the password is not valid, follow the on screen prompts to ensure the password meets all requirements.
I am constantly receiving session timeouts when trying to create a Master Account.|Remove all cookies in the browser you are trying to register with. Then, manually opt-in by visiting this link [https://sso.ctl.io/oxauth/enableSso](https://sso.ctl.io/oxauth/enableSso). Lastly, go back to the service, which should redirect you back to the Master Account screen and try to [create your Master Account again.](enhanced-security-master-account-registration.md)
I am unable to add my phone number|Ensure you are entering in a plus sign followed by your country calling code.  Ensure the phone number after that is correct. Example for US resident: +1-555-555-5555
Sign-In Issues|Steps to Resolve
I am unable to login.|Verify which account is being requested. For Master Accounts, you will enter in your email first, then be taken to another screen to enter your password. If you haven't linked an account for the service you are trying to access, you will be prompted to provide credentials for that service after logging into your Master Account. This process is only needed once if you check the "link my account" button. It will state "Account Linking" at the top. The service being linked will be stated in the information tab below that. In either scenario, you can reset your password by clicking the "Forgot your password" link below the login button.
The multi-factor code is not working.|Double check the system clock on your phone is accurate. If the clock on the phone is not correct, you will receive old codes.

Account Linking Issues|Steps to Resolve
I am prompted to enter my SavvisStation/Private Cloud credentials every time even though I've logged in with a Master Account.|The first time you log into a service after creating a Master Account, you will need to enter in the credentials of that service to link the accounts. When logging into the service, check the "link my account" button to create the link.  After this is done, you will no longer need to enter in the credentials of that service when logging in with your Master Account.  For more information regarding linking and unlinking accounts, [please review this KB article.](enhanced-security-linking-and-unlinking-accounts.md)
I receive an error stating my username or password is incorrect when trying to link a service account.|You can reset your password by clicking the "Forgot Password" link located below the sign-in button. If you are still receiving issues, you can [reach out to the Client Response Center for assistance.](#contacting-the-client-response-center)

### Email Issues
When you are registering your Master Account for the first time you will be emailed a token. This token allows us to verify that you have provided a valid email that you have access to. When you are waiting for the token to be emailed, a button labeled "Where's my email" will be presented after 3 minutes. Clicking this button will provide some information on where in the delivery process the email is. Below, we review the different responses, and provide guidance around those responses. 

The registration email is always sent from "noreply@ctl.io" with the subject "CenturyLink Email Validation Token".

**Q: How do I create my Enhanced Security Master Account?**

A:  [Please review this KB article that will walk you through the steps of creating your enhanced security Master Account.](enhanced-security-master-account-registration.md)

**Q: What is multi-factor authentication?**

A: Multi-factor authentication is a security standard that requires more than one method of authentication from independent sources to verify the identity of a user. Users who opt-in to multi-factor authentication will need to enter a 6-digit One-Time Password (OTP) every time they log into their Master Account, in addition to the username and password they set.

**Q: What do I need to know about setting up my multi-factor authentication?**

Multi-factor authentication comes with a few caveats, all of which explained during registration:
1. A smart phone with an app store is required.
2. An OTP Application on the phone is required such as Google Authenticator or OTP Authenticator.
3. You will need to use this soft token OTP app every time you log into your Master Account.
4. The system clock on the device being used to register your MFA needs to be accurate, or it will generate outdated codes.

**Q: Which browsers are currently supported?**

A: Below are the browsers currently supported:  

Browser|Version|
:---|---:|
Chrome|Latest Version
Firefox|Latest Version
Safari|Latest Version
Microsoft Edge|Latest Version

**Q: Can I link multiple SavvisStation, Private Cloud or Cloud Application Manager accounts to one Master Account?**

A: At this time, you can only link one of each type of account to a Master Account. If you have multiple accounts you wish to use, simply skip checking the "Link this account" check box when logging into the service. You will always need to use your Master Account credentials and ALSO enter your SavvisStation/Private Cloud credentials each time you want to log into the service under this method.

**Q: How can I remove or change a linked account?**

A: [Please review this KB article that will walk you through the steps of managing your linked accounts.](enhanced-security-linking-and-unlinking-accounts.md)
