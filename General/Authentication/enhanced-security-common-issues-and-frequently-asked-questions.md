### Description

As part of our efforts to increase the security of your accounts using the SavvisStation Portal and Private Cloud (DCC), you will need to go through a one-time setup to create a new Master Account.  Once setup is complete, for your security, you will receive a one-time prompt to provide credentials for your services to link them to your master account; as a result, you will be able to navigate between them without re-authenticating going forward. Other security improvements include optional multi-factor authentication through your smart phone (soft token) and the ability to set up multiple security questions for account validation and retrieval purposes.

This article will walk you through some of the common issues, and what steps you can take to resolve them.  It will also discuss how to ensure you are engaging the correct support team depending on your issue.  Lastly, we will answer some of the frequently asked questions.

### Common Issues  
Registration Issues|Steps to Resolve|
:---|:---|
I cannot click next on the password creation screen.|Ensure you are creating a valid password.  If the password is not valid, follow the on screen prompts to ensure the password meets all requirements.
I did not receive the registration email with my token.|Check your spam or junk folders for the email.  Also, verify that your email provider is not blocking the email.  The registration email is sent from "noreply@ctl.io" with the subject "CenturyLink Email Validation Token".  If you are still unable to find the email with the token, [engage our customer care team for assistance.](#contacting-the-customer-care-team)
I am constantly receiving session timeouts when trying to create a master account.|Remove all cookies in the browser you are trying to register with.  Then, manually opt-in by visiting this link [https://sso.ctl.io/oxauth/enableSso](https://sso.ctl.io/oxauth/enableSso).  Lastly, go back to the service, which should redirect you back to the master account screen and try to [create your master account again.](enhanced-security-master-account-registration.md)
**Sign-In Issues**|**Steps to Resolve**
I am unable to login.|Verify which account is being requested.  For Master Accounts, you will enter in your email first, then be taken to another screen to enter your password.  If you haven't linked an account for the service you are trying to access, you will be prompted to provide credentials for that service after logging into your master account.  This process is only needed once if you check the "link my account" button.  It will state "Account Linking" at the top.  The service being linked will be stated in the information tab below that.  In either scenario, you can reset your password by clicking the "Forgot your password" link below the login button.
The multi-factor code is not working.|Double check the system clock on your phone is accurate.  If the clock on the phone is not correct, you will receive old codes.

**Q: How do I create my Enhanced Security Master Account?**

A:  [Please review this KB article that will walk you through the steps of creating your enhanced security master account.](enhanced-security-master-account-registration.md)

**Q: What is multi-factor authentication?**

A: Multi-factor authentication is a security standard that requires more than one method of authentication from independent sources to verify the identity of a user. Users who opt-in to multi-factor authentication will need to enter a 6-digit One-Time Password (OTP) every time they log into their master account, in addition to the username and password they set.

**Q: What do I need to know about setting up my multi-factor authentication?**

Multi-factor authentication comes with a few caveats, all of which explained during registration:
1. A smart phone with an app store is required
2. An OTP Application on the phone is required such as Google Authenticator or OTP Authenticator
3. You will need to use this soft token OTP app every time you log into your master account
4. The system clock on the device being used to register your MFA needs to be accurate, or it will generate outdated codes.
