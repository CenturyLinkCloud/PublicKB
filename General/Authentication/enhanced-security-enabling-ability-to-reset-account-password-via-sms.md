### Description

As part of our efforts to increase the security of your accounts using the SavvisStation Portal and Private Cloud (DCC), you will need to go through a one-time setup to create a new Master Account.  Once setup is complete, for your security, you will receive a one-time prompt to provide credentials for your services to link them to your master account; as a result, you will be able to navigate between them without re-authenticating going forward. Other security improvements include optional multi-factor authentication through your smart phone (soft token) and the ability to set up multiple security questions for account validation and retrieval purposes.

When you forget your password, one of the steps is to enter in a token code.  This token code is sent via email, or if you have enabled it, via SMS.  This article shows you how to add your phone number so you can choose to send this token via SMS.

This article assumes that you have [created your master account](enhanced-security-master-account-registration.md) and you have [linked an account](enhanced-security-linking-and-unlinking_accounts.md).

### Steps
**1:** Logging in With Your Master Account

You should be directed to the Contact Details section.  In this section, you can enter in your mobile phone number.

*Example for US resident: +1-555-555-5555.  In this example, +1 is the country calling code.*  

Once the phone number has provided, enter your password and click the update button.
