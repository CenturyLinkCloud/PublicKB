In order to add an anchor links to an element on the page, for example a heading, you need to add the following raw html anchor link with the specified class, which will engage the custom javascript written to scroll to that section. The following sections have anchor links on the headings like so:

    ### Steps with Nested Steps <a id="anchor-1" class="kb-toc-anchor" href="#anchor-1"></a>

The above Table of Contents is a working example and all of the follwing section headings have the above anchor attached to them, but to keep things less cluttered, the markdown examples below do no include this in the print out.

<!-- CODE BLOCK - MARKDOWN - INDENT TWO SPACE -->

### Code Block Example <a id="anchor-7" class="kb-toc-anchor" href="#anchor-7"></a>

Anything indented 4 spaces (two tabs) in a markdown file will automatically generate a ```<pre><code></code></pre>``` around the content. For example, a piece of the gulpfile: <br>

    gulp.task "server", ->
      plugins.nodemon
        script: "server.js"
        ext: "js,coffee",
        ignore: [
          "gulpfile.coffee",
          "node_modules/*",
          "source/*",
          "test/*",
          "public/*",
          ".git/*",
          "views/*"
        ]

### Notes on Additional Sections <a id="anchor-8" class="kb-toc-anchor" href="#anchor-8"></a>

_The following sections, __Related Questions__ and __Attachments__, are created automatically via the configuration data added to the article at the top of this page. The sidebar content, __Related Products__ also comes from this configuration data. However, the last section, __Related Topics__ is automatically generated and is simply the all the other articles in the same category as this one._
