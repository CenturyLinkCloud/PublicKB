<!-- BREAK -->

In order to add an anchor links to an element on the page, for example a heading, you need to add the following raw html anchor link with the specified class, which will engage the custom javascript written to scroll to that section. The following sections have anchor links on the headings like so:

    ### Steps with Nested Steps <a id="anchor-steps" class="kb-toc-anchor" href="#anchor-steps"></a>

The above Table of Contents is a working example and all of the follwing section headings have the above anchor attached to them, but to keep things less cluttered, the markdown examples below do no include this in the print out.


<!-- TYPOGRAPHY -->

### Typography <a id="anchor-typography" class="kb-toc-anchor" href="#anchor-typography"></a>

The `h1` and `h2` tags are reserved for the page that's hosting the kb article, so headlines within the article itself start at `h3`.

### H3 Headline

#### H4 Headline

##### H5 Headline

### Code Block Example <a id="anchor-code-block" class="kb-toc-anchor" href="#anchor-code-block"></a>

Anything indented 4 spaces (two tabs) in a markdown file will automatically generate a ```<pre><code></code></pre>``` around the content. For example, a piece of the gulpfile: <br>

    gulp.task "server", ->
      plugins.nodemon
        script: "server.js"
        ext: "js,coffee",
        ignore: [
          "gulpfile.coffee",
          "node_modules/*",
          "source/*",
