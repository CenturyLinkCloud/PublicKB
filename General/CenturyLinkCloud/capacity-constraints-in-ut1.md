### Capacity Constraints in the Salt Lake City (UT1) Data Center

Occasionally we run into capacity issues with a data center. In this case, new server provisioning has been disabled for the UT1 data center. At this point in time, we do not have an ETA for when capabilities to provision will be offered again.

If you are a customer with an existing foot-print in UT1, and you require a small number of additional resources in that data center, then please submit a ticket with help@ctl.io and we will make every attempt to accommodate the request.
