###Supported Features

Core functions include:

* **Login/Logout.** Authenticate using the same credentials as the web version of the CenturyLink Cloud Control Portal. NOTE: SAML and navigation across subaccounts is not supported.
* **View Dashboard.** View a summary of resources deployed across CenturyLink’s network of cloud nodes. The app also shows a real-time estimate of usage and billing details. A “global” activity log is also available.
* **View Recent Activity.** See an activity log of recent actions, just like in the web version of the Control Portal. Each activity log is placed in context as well, so you see what’s relevant to a specific server, Group, or data center, depending on where you are in the application.
* **Servers.** View servers, adjust CPU, RAM, and storage values, and issue power commands. Supports read-only access to settings and other details.
* **Groups.** View Groups of servers across all data centers, including read-only access to settings and other details.
* **View Alerts.** See alerts for VMs in real-time; adjust resources to mitigate potential issues.
* **View Status.** See real-time operational status of CenturyLink Cloud nodes as well as notifications for planned maintenance via status.io.
