### Audience

Prospective Users of CenturyLink Cloud

### How do I get a free trial?

Visit [www.ctl.io/free-trial](http://www.ctl.io/free-trial). You will need a valid credit card and a mobile phone that supports text messaging (this is used to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent usage).

### What's included with a free trial?

Each free trial includes:

* Up to $2,500 in usage or 30 days usage of the service (whichever comes first)
* Free orientation from a CenturyLink Cloud solution architect
* Email & phone support from the solution architect during the trial
* Self-service access CenturyLink Cloud services, including cloud servers, block storage, load balancers, VLANs, [AppFog, based on Cloud Foundry](http://www.ctl.io/appfog/), and much more
* [Developer Support](http://www.ctl.io/support/) - this can be upgraded after the trial period at anytime

There are also some limits on rapid scale-up of resources; contact [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io) or your solution architect for more details.

When your trial period lapses, you will be billed on a monthly basis based on the cost of your environment.

### How long does it take to get a free trial account activated?

After you have entered the verification code, provided a valid credit card, and completed the activation form, your account will be created instantly. You will then receive an email with your account details. Representatives from CenturyLink Cloud will be in touch shortly thereafter to help you make the most of your trial.

### Who do I contact if my account is not immediately created?

Please send an email to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io) with relevant details.
