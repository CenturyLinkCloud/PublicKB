​
The CenturyLink Platform Enablement Team produces the following Digital Magazines ('eZines') that are designed to inspire users, developers and partners to engage and solve problems with our platform. They are:

  * **Ramp** - Targeted at *new* users of the platform
  * **View** - Targeted at seasoned users of the platform
  * **Code** - Targeted at developers of the platform
  * **Link** - Targeted to internal CTL audiences only to highlight platform success
​

Also, a few other products leverage Platform Enablement to produce product-specific newsletters for their technical audiences

  * **Orchestrate** produces a monthly newsletter
  * **Managed Services** delivers a periodic newsletter (Internal Only)

​
The ctl.io Outbound Email Program following the principles of **Permission Based Marketing**. Individuals only received the eZines once **Explicit Consent** is obtained. Explicit Consent is obtained in the following ways:

  * Establishment of a new account on ctl.io thru the online activation mechanism.
  * The opt-into one of the *signup* widgets on ctl.io.
  * Being an existing customer of ctl.io at the time the Outbound Email Program was established.
    * The ctl.io Outbound Email Program is fully compliant with US Anti-Spam Law, Canadian Anti-Spam Law (CASL) & European Union Regulations governing electronic communications (Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive). As such, all emails:
      * Clearly indicate the email is being sent by CenturyLink Cloud.
      * Contain a Unsubscrible Link.
      * A link to CenturyLink Cloud's Privacy Policy.

​
In addition to the ctl.io Outbound Email Communications, our Customer Support Team will periodically send out *Specical Announcments* with respect to the status of our platform or data centers.  For instance, our Customer Care Team will proactively send email communications to customers affected by planned maintainence or an incident ongoing in one of our data centers.

* Explicit Consent is also obtained for *Special Announcements*.  Consent is collected via the following vehicles for *Special Announcements*:
  * A user account is created on [Platform CenturyLink](https://control.ctl.io).
  * A user opts-in to receiving Customer Care *Special Announcements* via the ctl.io [Status Page](https://status.ctl.io).
* Consent to Digital Magazines is not assumed to infer consent to *Special Announcements*.

​
The final type of email communication sent by the ctl.io team surrounds Service End Of Life (EOL) messaging. We are legally bound to provide customer notification when a product(s) or service(s) they may be using is being terminated. In these cases, the responsible Product Owner(s) provide list of affected customers.

​
**NOTE:** As CenturyLink offers a platform that has many built-in reseller features, many of our customers are channel partners or internal corporate development groups who may not even know CenturyLink Cloud is powering their infrastructure. As a result, we make every effort NOT to send communications to downstream customers of resellers.  However, if one of those customers adds an account directly on the platform, or purposefully opts-in via one of the methods mentioned above, CenturyLink has no way of reactively excluding them unless the reseller informs us.
