### Description

Within the Support Portal, you can [create changes](creating-a-ticket-change-or-request.md) to be performed by Lumen or to [suppress alerts](viewing-your-active-alerts-and-suppressing-alerts-via-customer-performed-changes.md) against your devices.  Once your change is created, there are multiple ways to view and interact with that change to check status, provide an update, self-cancel, and more.  This article will cover the various ways you can view and interact with your Lumen-Performed, Customer-Performed, and Infrastructure Changes.

### Change Dashboard Summary View

The change dashboard view displays your earliest upcoming changes by start date.  This view will display up to 10 changes.  Changes of all types will display in this view.

### Lumen-Performed Change Detail View

Clicking on an Infrastructure Change will present you with a detailed view with additional information.  Infrastructure changes are purely for notification and transparency purposes, you are unable to edit the details of these changes as they are not at your request, but may be impacting the devices listed.  You can subscribe for notifications by clicking the ‘Subscribe Me’ slider.
