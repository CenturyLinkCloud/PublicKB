### Description

Within the Support Portal, you can [create changes](creating-a-ticket-change-or-request.md) to be performed by CenturyLink or to [suppress alerts](viewing-your-active-alerts-and-suppressing-alerts-via-customer-performed-changes.md) against your devices.  Once your change is created, there are multiple ways to view and interact with that change to check status, provide an update, self-cancel, and more.  This article will cover the various ways you can view and interact with your CenturyLink-Performed, Customer-Performed, and Infrastructure Changes.

### Change Dashboard Summary View

The change dashboard view displays your earliest upcoming changes by start date.  This view will display up to 10 changes.  Changes of all types will display in this view.
