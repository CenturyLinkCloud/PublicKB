**Please Note:**

- If this is your first time uploading a file, you must first select a file server location in accordance with GDPR compliance.

- You can create folders by clicking ‘Create Folder’.

- Your files display in List View by default.  You can change this to File View to see your files in an interface like a File Explorer on your computers’ operating system.
