### Description

Reporting can be configured to retrieve a historical and customizable list of your tickets, changes, and alerts.  You can apply specific filters to see your desired data.  Reports can be saved to be run later or scheduled to send reports to your email.  This article will walk through the process of creating a new report, scheduling for automated emails, and viewing/editing your existing reports.  Ticket reporting will be used as an example.

### Creating and Scheduling Reports

**1:** Navigate to the Support Portal and click Tickets > Ticket Reports.  Change and Alert reporting will be located in their respective locations.
