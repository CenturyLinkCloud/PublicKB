### Description

As part of our efforts to increase the security of your accounts using the SavvisStation Portal and Private Cloud (DCC), you will need to go through a one-time setup to create a new Master Account.  Once setup is complete, for your security, you will receive a one-time prompt to provide credentials for your services to link them to your master account; as a result, you will be able to navigate between them without re-authenticating going forward. Other security improvements include optional multi-factor authentication through your smart phone (soft token) and the ability to set up multiple security questions for account validation and retrieval purposes.

There may be times when you want to manually link or unlink an account.  This article steps you through this process.  This can be done after you have created your master account.

[If you haven't created your master account yet, please go here for a step by step guide.](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/general/enhanced-security-master-account-registration/)

You can link your SavvisStation account and then proceed to step 2.  Otherwise, you can hover over your name at the top right, click "Manage My Account", and proceed to step 3.
