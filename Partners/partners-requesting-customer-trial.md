### Action Items (for Partners) Recap:

**Pre-Trial Phase:**
* Customer sets up a customer account in the Control Portal.
* Partner requests trial by [emailing us](mailto:cloudpartnerhelp@centurylink.com) with the information mentioned above.

**Trial Phase:**
* Partner works closely with the customer to insure they are using the trial, answer questions as they arise, insure it’s a good customer experience, and monitor the customer’s usage so there are no surprise billings if the credit is depleted.
* Partner contacts the CenturyLink Trial Team to confirm the customers decision.

*(If we do not hear back from you, the partner, when the credit is depleted, CenturyLink will automatically begin billing on a monthly basis for that customer's usage).*
