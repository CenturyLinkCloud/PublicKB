### Support Introduction

CenturyLink Cloud’s comprehensive, secure, and global cloud platform is built for business &mdash; and we back it with business-class support options. Our reseller partner’s choose from the two different Support Tiers: **Professional** or **Enterprise**.

### Support Boundary

The partner provides Level 1 support to customers for all Cloud products that it resells. The following conditions apply to partner support services:
* The partner will include Level 1 support contact information in all web sites and materials that describe support distributed to customers.
* The partner cannot list CenturyLink Cloud support contact information for end customers.

#### Definition of Level 1 Support

This is the initial support level responsible for basic customer issues. It is synonymous with first-line support, Tier 1 support, front-end support, support line 1, and various other headings denoting basic level technical support functions. The first job of a Level 1 specialist is to gather the customer’s information and to determine the customer’s issue by analyzing the symptoms and figuring out the underlying problem. When analyzing the symptoms, it is important for the technician to identify what the customer is trying to accomplish so that time is not wasted on "attempting to solve a symptom instead of a problem."

This level should gather as much information as possible from the end user. The information could be computer system name, screen name or report name, error or warning message displayed on the screen, any logs files, screen shots, any data used by the end user or any sequence of steps used by the end user, etc. This information needs to be recorded into the issue tracking or issue logging system. This information is useful to analyze the symptoms to define the problem or issue.

Once identification of the underlying problem is established, the specialist can begin sorting through the possible solutions available. Technical support specialists in this group typically handle straightforward and simple problems while "possibly using some kind of knowledge management tool." This includes troubleshooting methods such as verifying the issues, resolving username and password problems, making necessary update to the portal, verification of proper portal set up, and assistance with navigating around application menus. Personnel at this level have a basic to general understanding of the product or service and may not always contain the competency required for solving complex issues. Nevertheless, the goal for this group is to handle 70%-80% of the user problems before finding it necessary to escalate the issue to a higher level.

CenturyLink Cloud will provide higher level support to partner under the following conditions:

*	CenturyLink Cloud support is provided in English only.
*	CenturyLink Cloud support team will work on the tickets based on the severity of the issue and the support level.

### Ticket Submission Process

The most efficient and effective way to contact the NOC team (CenturyLink Support) is to email or open ticket via portal.

#### Create Email Address

Partner needs to create one email alias for all the support ticket requests. All support team members who will submit and review should have access to this mailbox. This will enable the team to track the status of the ticket.

For example create xyz@yourcompany.com. This is an important step as this alias will be tied to our ticketing system (ZenDesk) when you email our support team.

#### Create ZenDesk account (using the Email created for Support)

Our support ticketing system, ZenDesk is where you can track all the updates to your support tickets. After your email address for support please follow the following steps to set up the ZenDesk account.

1. Log into https://t3n.zendesk.com
2. Click on “Sign up” on the upper right hand side of the page and fill the form shown below. Please enter the email address you created for the support team.
**NOTE: CenturyLink will only recognize the email address associated with ZenDesk. Any support request from another email address will not be converted into a ticket. So please use the same email address for escalation.**
3. After you Sign up, you will receive a welcome email from noc@ctl.io for verification. Click on the verification link and choose your password. Your account will be active right away.


### Information for Submitting the Ticket

Partners need to make sure they email the right email alias based on the urgency of the issue. You can use the ZenDesk for submitting tickets, the default priority for those tickets will be normal. We recommend emailing. The following information needs to be provided while submitting a ticket:

*	Partner Ticket Number (if tracked under a different number on your end)
*	Customer Name and Alias
*	External IP
*	Root/Admin Password if CenturyLink Cloud (still referred as Tier3 account) to Login
*	PIN (It is under Profile setting - details in section below)
*	Server Name
*	Your control.ctl.io Username and Pin Number
*	Copy of the Error(s)
*	Brief description of the problem
*	Troubleshooting steps we have taken to verify/solve the problem
*	Which Stack the Error/Server is on that is Having Issues
*	Screenshot of Issue if Possible/Available
*	Your Full Name on all Ticket Updates
*	Email Address of Anyone That Needs to be cc’d. The best practise is to add your Account Rep at CenturyLink to this email


### SLA for Support

The priority designation indicates the level, extent and impact on the customer. Once assigned, the priority level is used to determine the resources allocated for resolving the ticket, timelines for resolution and escalation matrix. Customers may assign the priority to tickets they create. Each incoming ticket is triaged and the priority will be assigned according to the criteria defined below.


### Support and Service Management

#### Support Options

CenturyLink offers three support tiers for end user customers: Developer, Professional and Enterprise. Developer is designed strictly for non-critical developer environments, and is not an appropriate level of service for reseller partners. In order to provide required level of support for our channel partners, either Professional or Enterprise level support is required. The table below outlines the features and SLA’s of each offering support.


The following table describes list of operational support activities and requests offered across CenturyLink Cloud support tiers that may arise for virtual machines (VMs) provisioned on the CenturyLink Cloud platform.
