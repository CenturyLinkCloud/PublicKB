### What Is "White Labeling"?
"White Labeling" simply means you can remove specific CenturyLink brand elements and information and replace them with you own:
* site branding (logo, site name, footer)
* color scheme
* email notifications
* customer support

White Labeling does not mean modifying or changing in any way the  functional content (such as server functionality). For example, a CenturyLink Cloud partner cannot rewrite the portal in another language.
