### Description (goal/purpose)

This article outlines the process for submitting an SLA Credit in the Control Portal following an Urgent Incident. Currently, the SLA Credit Tool in the Control Portal only calculates Server impact. For all other impacted services, please submit an SLA Credit request to help@ctl.io.

### How do I know if I qualify for an SLA Credit?

The minimum period of failure eligible for a credit is 15 consecutive minutes, and shorter periods will not be aggregated. For additional information pertaining to credit eligibility, please reference our Service Level Agreement under Credit Limitations.

### How do I submit an SLA Credit request in the Control Portal?

You will need to log into [credit.ctl.io](https://credit.ctl.io) using your Control Portal credentials. Once you are logged in, you will see a list of all Urgent Master Tickets that have been generated after an incident has been resolved. To claim an SLA Credit, click on the box located on the left-hand side and submit Claim credits on the top header. Before you claim a credit, please review all assets impacted under the Urgent Master Ticket. If you do not agree with the data provided, please submit an SLA Credit dispute to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io).

### How do I know the status of my SLA Credit request?

Once you have submitted an SLA Credit through Credit.ctl.io, it will be shown as Claimed. The claim is then routed to our CenturyLink Cloud Billing team for review. After the CenturyLink Cloud Billing team has reviewed and approved your SLA Credit claim, it will reflect the status Pending. Lastly, it is assigned to the Finance team for official approval. If the SLA Credit claim is approved, it will reflect the status Posted in the SLA Credit Tool.

### How will I know if my SLA Credit is approved or denied?

If your SLA Credit is approved by our CenturyLink Cloud Finance team it will display as Posted in the SLA Credit Tool. If your SLA Credit is not approved by our CenturyLink Cloud Finance team, you will be notified with an explanation as to why the 
SLA Credit was not granted at this time. For additional information pertaining to this, please submit a request to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io).

### What happens when an SLA Credit is approved?

If your SLA Credit is approved, it will be Posted in the SLA Credit Tool which will then be added as a one-time credit on your next billing cycle.

### How do I dispute an SLA Credit?

For all SLA Credit disputes, please submit a request to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io).
