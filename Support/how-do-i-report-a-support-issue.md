### FAQ

**I have an email thread with my sales team on this issue. Why is this not being worked?**

The CenturyLink Cloud Customer Care team does not use email to provide support. All issues are tracked in the ZenDesk ticketing system.

**I just reopened a ticket - now what?**

When you reopen a ticket by responding after it's been marked "solved" (and within 72 hours), it is returned to the Support queue and a Customer Care engineer will respond in accordance with our [Ticket Prioritization Matrix. ](../Support/ticket-prioritization-matrix.md)

**How long do you wait before closing a ticket?**

After a ticket has been Solved, the automation will close the the ticket after 72 hours (3 days). All subsequent communication to the closed ticket will create a new "follow-up" ticket at normal priority.
