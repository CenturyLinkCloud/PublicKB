### Overview
Lumen Cloud offers a robust, self-service cloud environment for building and maintaining complex infrastructure topologies. There are times, however, when native functionality doesn't provide the desired result. In some cases, Lumen will approve a custom configuration. We aim to delight every customer in whatever way we can, and thus offer this option. However,  the Lumen Cloud team is extremely selective about approving non-standard configurations because they introduce the possibility for human error and may cause side effects with system automation.

#### How should Custom Requests be submitted?
All customer requests (e.g. support, service tasks, product questions) should be sent to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io). If that request requires a custom configuration, the support engineer will route it for approval.

#### What qualifies as a custom request?
By default, anything that cannot be done via self-service or [Service Task](https://www.ctl.io/service-tasks/) is categorized as a Custom Request.

#### What is the evaluation process?
Custom Requests are sent to a queue monitored by Lumen Cloud management. An executive reviews each request and approves or rejects the request after careful consideration (note that a custom request that was approved in the past MAY not get approved a second time). The result of the Custom Request review process is then communicated back to the customer.

#### How long does it take for a request to get evaluated?
There is no SLA on custom requests, but all items are typically reviewed and acted upon within 72 hours. If the request is urgent then it may be escalated using the [how do I escalate a ticket](../Support/how-do-i-escalate-a-ticket.md) process.

#### What are the possible outcomes?
After assessing the details of the Custom Request, the Lumen Cloud team will either accept or reject the request. If accepted, we will either perform the work outright, or based on complexity, offer to do it as part of a [Service Task](https://www.ctl.io/service-tasks/). The customer can then choose whether or not they wish to still have this work performed.
