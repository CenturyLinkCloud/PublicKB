Customers occasionally request specific infrastructure information of our platform, e.g., make and model of the network gear, hypervisor and storage fabric, the software versions that are implemented, the number of infrastructure-related assets deployed in a data center, and so forth. These specifications are deemed as sensitive, proprietary, business-critical information. We have a strict policy to uphold confidentiality regarding this information. Please understand that this policy is in place to ensure the safety, reliability, and competitive viability of our cloud computing platform.

See our [Compliance site](https://www.ctl.io/compliance/) for information about the security controls in place to mitigate risk and ensure stability.

Please direct any additional questions or concerns you may have to help@ctl.io.
