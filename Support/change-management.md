        <p>Potentially Disruptive</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>This category covers maintenance where CenturyLink Cloud&nbsp;cannot remove or migrate the live customer data from the system but it is expected that the maintenance will have no customer impact. An example of this is upgrading the redundant controllers
          on storage units that allow hot upgrading. It is highly recommended to migrate as much live customer data off of the hardware/service that is about to undergo maintenance.</p>
