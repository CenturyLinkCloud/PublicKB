<p>All changes performed by CenturyLink Cloud&nbsp;will be done in compliance with the following criteria:</p>

<p>1. All Network changes will be performed outside of local datacenter time of 8:00am to 5:00pm Monday through Friday, to provide greater network stability during core business hours. The exception is for break/fix work during an Urgent Incident or in extreme circumstances.</p>

<p>2. All of the change types listed below can be performed as an emergency change where maintenance needs to be performed immediately except where it conflicts with section 1 above. In these abnormal situations, no customer notification is required.</p>

      </td>
      <td>
        <p>This category covers maintenance where CenturyLink Cloud&nbsp;cannot remove or migrate the live customer data from the system but it is expected that the maintenance will have no customer impact. An example of this is upgrading the redundant controllers
          on storage units that allow hot upgrading. It is highly recommended to migrate as much live customer data off of the hardware/service that is about to undergo maintenance.</p>
