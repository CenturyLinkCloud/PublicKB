### Overview

The CenturyLink Cloud Platform periodically sends informational emails and alerts notifying users of any Platform changes, incidents, and scheduled maintenance periods. These informational emails are separate from the environment-specific alerts that might be generated by individual servers, such as high resource utilization, connectivity, etc. System notification emails are only sent to users selected under Notification Contacts.

Many of our enterprise customers have roles within their organization that need to be apprised of system maintenance or other events, but they  are not necessarily daily users of the Platform. This article covers how to properly configure system notifications for this scenario.

### Audience

All users of CenturyLink Cloud

### Prerequisites

Must be assigned the [Account Administrator](//www.ctl.io/role-permissions-matrix) role permission to edit Notification Contacts

### Steps

1. Navigate in the Control Portal to the Notifications tab. From the left-hand menu, Settings > Notifications  

  ![Notification](../images/configuring-system-notification-emails1.PNG)

2. Select the desired contact from the drop-down list of users.

### Configuring Additional Recipients

In order to send emails to additional email addresses, there are two methods to ensure that the appropriate users receive notifications.

1. Create a user account for each resource requiring notification and assign them the Account Admin role permission.
2. Create an internal distribution list (i.e. CLCNotifications@companyname.com), use that email address to create an account in the Control Portal and then assign it the Account Administrator role permission. Please note that a "Welcome" email containing a password is emailed to each newly-created user in the Control Portal. If you do not want this automatic "Welcome" email to be disseminated, create the distribution list, create the user in the Control Portal, and then add the appropriate internal resources to the distribution list.

Please note that creating these user accounts only ensures that they will receive system-wide email notifications. If you wish to configure environmental alarms and alerts, that is a separate process carried out at either the server group or individual server level.
