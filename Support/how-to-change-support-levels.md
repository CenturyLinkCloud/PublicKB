### Overview
Lumen Cloud offers three different [Support Levels](https://www.ctl.io/support/):
* Developer (Default for customers who have signed up via the web)
* Professional (Default option for contracts)
* Enterprise (Premier level of support)

Developer support is free, while pricing for Professional and Enterprise support tiers is graduated based on usage. Support Level pricing is described [here](https://www.ctl.io/support/), in the section titled "Pricing".

### Determine Your Current Support Level
1. To determine your current Support Level, log into the [Control Portal](https://control.ctl.io), click "Settings" and then "Account Settings".

2. Click "Support" on the Settings Tab. In the Support Service Level section, find "Support Level".

### Change your Support Level
An Account Administrator (i.e., a user account with the Account Administrator [role](https://www.ctl.io/role-permissions-matrix/#A-Management)) can request to change the Support Level for an account.  To do so, send an email to [help@ctl.io](mailto:help@ctl.io) and include the following information:
* Account Alias to be changed
* Support Level (Developer, Professional, or Enterprise)
* Your Control account username and [account PIN](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/support/pin-authentication-for-support-requests/) for security verification purposes

Your email will generate a ticket to the Customer Care team, who may contact you for further information. You will receive  confirmation when the change has been made to the account.
