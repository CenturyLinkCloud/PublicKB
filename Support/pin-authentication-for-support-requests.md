1. login to the [Control Portal.](//control.ctl.io)

2. Once you have logged in, click your **Username** in the top right hand corner of the page and select **My Account.**

3. Your PIN will be displayed on the user profile page.

### Set Your Own PIN
If you wish to manually set your PIN, mouse-over the PIN field and click. You can then enter a custom PIN (numeric, no alphabetic or special characters, 10 character limit).  Once completed save your new PIN.
