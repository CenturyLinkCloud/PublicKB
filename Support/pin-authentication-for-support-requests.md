### Overview
When submitting a support request, CenturyLink Cloud requires that the requester supply a personal identification number (PIN) as a secondary means of authentication. This measure is designed to add an additional layer of security to prevent user impersonation and unauthorized changes.

### Finding Your PIN
1. Log in to the [Control Portal](//control.ctl.io).
2. Click your username in the top-right corner of the page, and select **My Account**.

Your PIN will be displayed on the user profile page.

   - no alphabetic/special characters
   - 10 character limit
