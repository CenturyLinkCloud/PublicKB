<p>When submitting a support request, CenturyLink Cloud requires that the user supply a pre-defined, unique&nbsp;PIN number as a secondary means of authentication. This measure is designed to add an additional layer of security to prevent account impersonation
  and unauthorized changes.</p>
<p>To access or change your PIN, login to the Control Portal. Once you have logged in, click the "<strong>Profile" </strong>icon (the "person" icon)&nbsp;and select “<strong>Profile</strong>”:</p>

</p>

<p>Your PIN will be displayed on the following screen:</p>

</p>
<p>If you wish to manually set your PIN, highlight the PIN field and click. You can then enter a custom PIN (numeric, no alphabetic or special characters, 10 character limit)</p>

<p>Click “<strong>Save</strong>” to finish setting your custom PIN.</p>

<p> <strong>*** Note ***</strong></p> <p>When submitting a support request, if you have multiple accounts, please indicate which username corresponds to the PIN you are supplying.</p>
