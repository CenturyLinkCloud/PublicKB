### Description

This article will outline the step-by-step process to provision a bare metal server within the Lumen Edge Services portal specific to the contracted server configuration approved for Solana validators.

### Prerequisites

The Solana Validator needs to add credentials for the instance type (Linux or Windows) in their profile. Then at deployment the applicable credentials for the provisioning user are added to the server by default.

If you have yet to add credentials for the instance type (Linux or Windows) to your profile, please do that step now by following the steps below. 

Failure to add credentials for the instance type in the User Profile will cause you to be locked out of accessing the server.

In the event that you accidentally provision a server prior to adding your credentials, please delete the server, set your credentials, and deploy a new server.

**Steps to add Linux and Windows Settings**
1. Log into the Edge Services portal.
2. In the top right corner of the Edge Services Portal, click on your Name.
3. Click **User Settings**.
4. Enter your Linux and Windows username(s) and password(s). 
 **Note:** Ubuntu is the approved OS for Solana validators, it is a required step that you enter your Linux credentials under **User Settings**.
5. Press **Save**.

### Steps to Provision a Solana Validator Edge Bare Metal Server

Log into your Lumen Edge account within the Lumen Edge Services portal.
To start the Provision Server process, use the top navigation and choose **Provisioning**.

1.	Under the **Provisioning** tab, choose **Instances**.

 An Instanceâ€™s environment label can be changed by editing the Instance.

 **Label**
 - Required field, free text, no cost.
 Customers can add labels to the servers as they see fit.
 Labels just provide another way for customers to manage, report, or group servers.
5. Configuration Options
 In this section, you will see multiple fields. Once you have made selections for all the required fields, please review each for accuracy, and press the **NEXT** button to proceed to the next steps.
 Please note, there are some prerequisites and actions users must take for some fields below. Please read this section carefully before moving on to Step 7.
 ![Configuration Options](../images/Solana-Validator_grphx/005_Solana-V_configuration-options.png)

Below outlines the purpose of each field in the image above.
 
 **Version**
 - Required field, drop down, cost based on OS.
 The operating system approved for Solana Validator software is Ubuntu 20.04. Choose the 20.04 version under the version drop down field. 
 
 **Layout**
 - Required field, pre-populated, cost based on OS.
 This fields pre-populated with the Operating System you selected in Step 4.
 
 **IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SOLANA VALIDATORS**
 There is only one Bare Metal Server plan that is approved for Solana Validator software. 
 It is the responsibility of the Solana validator to select the approved server plan. If the wrong server plan is selected, the validator is responsible for any incurred charges and will be billed accordingly. 
 Solana validators are approved to purchase up to two validator servers at the special Solana contracted rate per the contract you signed. 
 The two validator servers will not have egress bandwidth charges applied. 
 The list pricing in the portal applies to any services you procure above and beyond the two validator servers that are outlined in the Solana Validator contract. 
 The special pricing will be applied at the time of invoicing and the price in the portal is rounded to the nearest hourly unit using the formula below.

 **ASSUMPTIONS FOR CALCULATION OF HOURLY COMPUTE**
 - 720 hours in a month
 - 30.42 days in a month
 - 4.35 weeks in a month
 Validators can purchase other plans and services with the Edge Services portal. Please note that those services will all bill at list price. For estimated costing of list prices for Edge services outside of the Solana validator contract, please visit the [Edge Price Estimator](https://www.ctl.io/estimator/).

 **Plan**
 - Required field. Select the approved server configuration under the plan drop down field. The approved server configuration and plan for Solana validators is listed below.
 **Cores: 32 RAM (GB): 256 Storage (GB): 2400**

 Per the Solana Validator contract that you signed, validators can provision up to two Solana validator Bare Metal instances.

 **Bandwidth**
 - Required field, drop down.
 This field is where you select your Network Bandwidth.

 **Egress is waived for Solana Validators at the 1 Gbps rate for up to 2 Solana Validator Bare Metal Servers**
 The approved Bandwidth rate Selection for Solana Validator Software is 1 Gbps. It is the responsibility of the Solana validator to select the approved Bandwidth selection of 1 Gbps. If you select any other Bandwidth rate other than 1 Gbps, you could incur egress charges based on your true usage. 
 **Note for list pricing for egress**
 Public Internet Egress is charged based upon total number of bytes transferred over the course of the month.
 Bandwidth selection identifies the requested rate limit for the internet port and is selected during the provisioning of the Bare Metal server instance.
 **Note:** Higher rate limits can pass more traffic, which could result in additional Internet charges.
 Customers should choose the Bandwidth selection that best fits their business needs to avoid unintended Internet charge spikes.
 Network charges are outlined in this [Knowledge Base article](https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/edge-computing-solutions/getting-started/edge-bare-metal-billing/).
