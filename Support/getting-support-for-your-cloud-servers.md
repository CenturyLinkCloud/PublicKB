### Overview

CenturyLink Cloud has the capability for customers to report issues via the phone or chat. All incoming phone calls and chats are initially classified as a low priority ticket. If you are experiencing a critical, issue, it is far more expedient to open an appropriately prioritized ticket via the ticket automation system. There are engineers available and working the queues 24x7.</p>

### Audience

#### How to Create a Ticket

* Review the [ticket prioritization matrix](./ticket-prioritization-matrix.md)
* Determine your desired priory according to your understanding of the criteria in the matrix
* Send an email to the appropriate email address, defined in item 1. Please do not forward existing emails or old email threads because the automation will recognize this as an old item and will only assign a Low priority.
