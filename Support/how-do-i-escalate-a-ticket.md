### Description (goal/purpose)


1. I have submitted a support request and need it to be executed immediately.
2. I have submitted a ticket and would like to escalate it.
3. CenturyLink Cloud did not deliver or perform what they committed to deliver in a ticket.

### Audience

- Customers who have a paid support contract</li>


### Pre-Requisites

- Please DO NOT forward a previous ticket to this mechanism because the automation will add your email to that ticket.
- Ticket number of the ticket that describes the issue in detail.
- Please review the [Ticket Prioritization Matrix](../Support/ticket-prioritization-matrix.md)
- Please ensure that this issue being escalated requires escalation. The majority of the escalation team reside in Seattle and please be aware of the time when you escalate.
- Please have someone available to respond to any information request from CenturyLink Cloud. The majority of the time, these requests will be made via the original ticket. Not having someone available could delay the resolution of the issue
    and defeats the purpose of the escalation mechanism.


### Steps

1. **Please review the Ticket Prioritization Matrix so that you understand what priority your ticket should be.**
2. **A NEW TICKET must be created by a separate email. Forwarding or CC'ing an existing ticket will prevent automation from handling the request properly and an escalation will not occur. Email escalation@ctl.io with the following information:**

  Subject: ESCALATION: Ticket - <your ticket number>

  Body: Your message and a brief explanation of why you are escalating the ticket.

3. **A ticket will be created in our system for your escalation and it will be automatically escalated to the CenturyLink Cloud operations management.**

### FAQ

**Is this capability available 24x7?**

Yes, while the management team that responds to these requests is based on the US West Coast, they do respond to escalations within 15 minutes. *The exception is an escalation for Service Tasks, which are only acknowledged from 7am-7pm Pacific*.

**What criteria are used to evaluate a Service Request escalation request?**

The members of the escalation team are members of the CenturyLink Cloud Support Management team. They will review the age of the original ticket, clarity of information in the original ticket, scope, skill level, and time of day of the request.

**Will I be charged for escalating a ticket?**

In general no; however for parties that misuse the escalation mechanism, CenturyLink Cloud does reserve the right to charge.

**I do not have a paid support contract, what will happen when I use this mechanism?**

The automation will check to validate your contract and if you do not have a support contract, your escalation will not complete successfully.

**I have escalated an issue but am not satisfied with the resolution of that escalation.  What can I do?**

If you wish to escalate to the executive level:

1. **Email execescalation@ctl.io with the following information:**
  
    Subject: ESCALATION: Ticket - <your ticket number>
  
    Body: Your message and a brief explanation of why you are escalating the ticket.
  
2. **A ticket will be created in our system for your Executive escalation and it will be automatically escalated to the CenturyLink Cloud Executive Management.**
