### Description

This communication is an important announcement regarding the migration from CenturyLink Cloud public IPs. This document is to provide CenturyLink Cloud customers with information how to identify if a public IP is impacted and how to migrate.

###  What IPs Require Migration?

Any CenturyLink Cloud public IP that is not within the following range is an impacted IP and will require migration: 65.151.128.0/17 (65.151.128.0 - 65.151.255.255).

### Why Is Migration Happening?

* Better governance over our networks.
* Increased security by adding DDoS mitigation in the new IP range. This is not possible with some of the existing ranges. 


### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What products will be impacted?**

* Servers using public IP addresses 
* Existing IPSec (Site-to-Site) VPN tunnels 

**Q: How do I migrate a public IP assigned to a server?**

Simply remove and assign a new public IP via the Control Portal and a new IP within the range 65.151.128.0/17 will be assigned. Our [Public IP Article](../Network/CenturyLink Cloud/how-to-add-public-ip-to-virtual-machine.md) provides detailed instructions.

One migration method is to [assign a second internal IP](../Servers/how-to-associate-additional-private-ips-with-a-cloud-server.md) to your server, then add a corresponding new public IP. Next update DNS records to point to the new public IP. Once satisfied with the migration, release the original public IP via the Control Portal. Note, release of the initial internal IP in the Control Portal will require a support request to help@ctl.io.

**Q: How do I migrate an existing IPSec VPN**

Our [March 31 Release Notes](../Release Notes/2020/2020-03-31-cloud-platform-release-notes.md) recently announced that any changes to an existing self-service IPSec VPN will automatically update the CLC peer IP with the new IP range. 

Custom IPSec VPNs that are not displayed in the Control Portal will require manual configuration changes to complete migration. Please contact our Customer Care Team via help@ctl.io for assistance.

**Q: When is migration required?**

A final migration date is not yet available, more information will be provided regarding final deadlines. Our intent is to provide as much advanced notice as possible. Migration is encouraged at the earliest possible customer convenience.

**Q: My Public IP is in the range 65.151.128.0 - 65.151.255.255, is there anything I need to do?**

Nothing is required, your Public IP is already in the correct range.
