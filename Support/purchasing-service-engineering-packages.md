<p>Service Engineering is available in 20, 40, 60, 80, 160 and multiples of 160-hour blocks per month. Customers interested in “Enterprise” support must purchase at least 160 hours per month of Service Engineering.</p>
<p>Customers can purchase 20, 40, 60 and 80 hours of time on a month-to-month basis.  A one-year commitment is required for 160 hours (or greater) of monthly service time.</p>
<p>In addition, the graduated Standard Professional or Enterprise support uplift fees apply. Service Engineering is not available to customers who choose the Developer level of support. Service Engineering hours must be used on a monthly basis and
  unused time does not rollover to the following month.</p>
<p>In the event a customer requires hours in addition to the block of hours purchased, an hourly Service Engineering fee will be applied for hours used beyond the monthly block.  Customers who purchase Service Engineering in less than 160 hour blocks can
  submit support requests around the clock to the shared pool of engineering resources; however, consultative related requests need to be scheduled in advance.</p>
<p><strong><em>About Designated Support</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Customers who purchase 160 hours or greater blocks of time are assigned a designated person within the Service Engineering team as a primary point of contact. Additional designated contacts are assigned per block of 160 hour support purchased.</p>
<p>This primary point of contact will works a specified shift based on the Customer’s needs. Consultative requests are performed during that shift. The 160 hour block of time assumes a designated point of contact working 40 hours per week, with a four week
  per month average. It also assumes that services are performed evenly throughout the month.</p>
<p>CenturyLink will begin staffing of 160 hour block resources when Customer orders Service Engineering; it may take up to two months to hire personnel.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cloud Expertise, Not OS &amp; Application Level Expertise</em></strong>
</p>
<p>CenturyLink Cloud Service Engineers are CenturyLink Cloud platform oriented and are knowledgeable on cloud solution architectures but are not operating system or application layer experts. Customers who desire expertise for operating systems or applications
  are encouraged to purchase Service Management Technical Service Engineers where expertise is available for Windows, Red Hat, Database and Applications.</p>
