**Managing Your Marketplace Subscriptions**


### Description
In this KB article, we walk through how to manage your Marketplace subscriptions via the [Marketplace Manager](https://marketplace.ctl.io/). The Marketplace Manager provide Marketplace customers with a dashboard view into all of their Marketplace subscriptions and estimated monthly billing charges.

### Audience

* Marketplace customer

### Steps to Manage Marketplace Subscriptions

**Log in:** You can log in to the Marketplace Manager by going to https://marketplace.ctl.io/ and using your Lumen Cloud credentials to log in. You can also access the Marketplace Manager via the Lumen Cloud control portal at https://control.ctl.io/, and log in using your Lumen Cloud account credentials. Once in the Lumen Cloud control portal you can access the Marketplace Manager under the **Orchestration** tab, then click **Marketplace Manager.**

**Reviewing Subscriptions:** Once logged in you can view your Marketplace subscriptions, see estimated monthly charges, request updates to your subscriptions (such as upgrades or downgrades), and terminate subscriptions (if no active term commit is in place). Please note that any taxes, overage, or usage based charges associated with your order are not listed. Rather, they will be reflected on your monthly invoices when applicable.

All subscriptions are shown at the Subscription Order level. By clicking the **+ Show Billable Items** button the subscription will expand to show all billable items that are associated with the subscription. These billable items can include monthly, hourly, usage, and one-time charges. You can collapse the billable items by clicking the **- Hide Billable Items** button.

**Managing Subscriptions:** There are two actions that can be executed in the Marketplace Manager; **Update** and **Terminate**.

### Update Request

The **Update** button allows customers to update their Marketplace subscriptions.

The Update option can be used for various use cases, below are a few examples.  

If a customer wants to add additional quantities to a billable item in their subscription:
Ex. Customer has a 10 license seat subscription and wants to add 10 additional license seats.

The customer can also use the Update option to downgrade their subscription:
Ex. Customer has a 100 license seat subscription and wants to downgrade to an 80 license seat subscription.

The downgrade option can also be used if a customer wants to terminate only some of the billable items for the subscription:
Ex. Customer has a subscription that has a core product with multiple add-ons and customer wants to terminate one or all of the add-ons but NOT the core product.

#### Steps to Make an Update Request

1. To update a subscription click on the **Update** button. The form below will populate.

The options are:

a. Update Billable Items

### Terminate

The **Terminate** button allows customers to terminate their Marketplace subscriptions that do NOT have an active term commit associated with them. If there is an active term commit associated with the subscription, the terminate button will not populate for that subscription until 30 days prior to the end of the term commit date. For subscriptions with term commits, you will be notified via email 30 days prior to your term commit end date. If you choose to keep the service no action is needed on your part. The subscription will auto-renew for the same terms. If you wish to terminate the subscription, you must do so via the Terminate request prior to the term commit end date.

#### Steps to Make a Terminate Request

1. To make a termination request for a subscription, click on the **Terminate** button. The form below will populate.
