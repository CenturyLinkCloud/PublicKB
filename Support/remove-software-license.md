### Description (goal/purpose)
 
1.	Software installed via blueprint is not functioning correctly but a license charge for the software has been applied to the server. 
2.	Blueprint did not install the software but the license charge was still applied to the server.
 
### Audience
 
- Customers that received software charges for a failed blueprint installation.</li>
 
### Scenarios
The following scenarios and actions are based on policies that are set by the respective software vendor and their License agreements.  Once software licenses are bound to a machine, it cannot be "detached" from it.  Software will need to be either re-installed or the machine deleted to remove any bound software licensing costs of the server.   
 
1.	If the Blueprint failed due to a missing prerequisite (not enough disk space, etc), we recommend our customers to take corrective actions to meet the prereqs then re-run the Blueprint(s).
 
2.	For any circumstances that are beyond remediation of the failed software installation, you must delete the machine(s) that have the software licenses. 
 
3.	If you simply want to remove a software license from a machine no longer using the software, you will need to create a new server, migrate the data, then delete your old machine.  
 
If you were charged for software that you were unable to use due to installation failure you may request credit for the current month's license cost for that software
