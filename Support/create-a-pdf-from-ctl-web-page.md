### Overview
If you should ever need to produce a printable PDF from any page on the www.ctl.io website, we have provided a handy tool.

### Scroll Down to the Footer
In the footer of every page, there's a text link under *Support* that reads *PDF This Page*. Click on that link and the CenturyLink wheel icon will start to spin, indicating that the PDF is being written. Once created, the PDF will download automatically to your desktop.

### Resolution vs. File Size
You may notice that the resolution on the PDF is not very high. That's due to the tradeoff between resolution and file size. The higher the resolution, the more massive the PDF. We decided to strike a balance and deliver a PDF that's a bit on the low end for resolution, but delivers a file size that's more manageable. Even so, many PDF files created will be far too large to email. Pages that are extremely dense in content, or have many graphics and charts, will deliver large PDFs. In such cases, we recommend you simply zip the file for transmittal.
