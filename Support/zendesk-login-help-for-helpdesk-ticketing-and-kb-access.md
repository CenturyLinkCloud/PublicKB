### Description (Goal/Purpose)
CenturyLink Cloud utilizes Zendesk ([support.ctl.io](https://support.ctl.io)) for ticketing. This allows for the ability to receive email updates and create/view tickets in a web interface. The creation of a free account is required for access which is different than a [Control Portal](https://control.ctl.io) account.
