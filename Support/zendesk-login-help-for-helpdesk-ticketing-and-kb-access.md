### Description (Goal/Purpose)
CenturyLink Cloud implements with Zendesk ([support.ctl.io](https://support.ctl.io)) for support ticketing services. This provides our customers with the capability to receive email updates on tickets they have opened with us.  It also enables access to the support web interface, where users can create, view, and edit request tickets. Access to the support web interface requires the creation of a Zendesk account, which is separate from your [Control Portal](https://control.ctl.io) user account.
