### Description

For customers that want to know more information about their estimated resource usage on CenturyLink Cloud, several options are available. This article explains a few of them.

### Self-Service Tools

Customers can analyze a detailed breakdown of estimated usage history in several different ways:

* __Via the Control Portal.__ Click on `Billing` in the main navigation link, then click `Usage History`. From there, click the month of interest to display a line-item view of your estimated usage. Click a line for more information on each item, such as a Group of servers.

  ![Usage Summary Detail](../images/usage_summary_detail.png)

* __Via Excel or other Spreadsheet Tool.__ From the screen shown above, click `download csv` for an Excel-friendly format of the estimated billing data.

* __Via API.__ Users can get usage estimates using [a simple REST call](https://www.ctl.io/api-docs/v2/#billing). The API will return a JSON object containing an array with invoicing data.

NOTE: The dollar amounts shown for these options will reflect what is configured in your [pricing catalog](../General/setting-default-prices-for-sub-accounts.md) for each account. Further, the summaries above, by design, do not display detailed timestamps of events that affect billing. However, platform activities that affect usage - such as pausing a server for a weekend - are reflected in your real-time estimates throughout the Control Portal AND in your actual usage estimate.

### Request a Service Task

More detailed usage is available upon request [as a service task](https://www.ctl.io/service-tasks/#usage-reporting).
