Tickets are worked according to priority in the order in which they are received. The priority designation indicates the level, extent, and impact on the customer.

Customers may assign the priority of normal or high to tickets they create by using the correct email address to create the ticket. Once assigned, the priority level is used to determine the resources allocated for resolving the ticket, timelines for resolution, and the escalation matrix.

Each incoming ticket is triaged and the priority evaluated according to the criteria defined below. The following matrix covers Support Incidents, Requests, Questions and Service Task Requests. Billing and Sales Inquiries are not included in this matrix or SLA.
