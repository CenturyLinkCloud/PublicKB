## Introduction
We encourage feature request submissions from customers either through our [email alias](mailto:features@ctl.io) or through the Control Portal.

More details on that process can be found [here](../Support/how-do-i-submit-a-feature-request.md).

### So what happens once ideas are submitted?

Here's the process.

1. Each item is reviewed by a cross-section of stakeholders, lead by our product ownership team.
2. The item is either rejected or accepted. A decision is either reached immediately, or is postponed to allow for "community" feedback based on a larger external audience.
3. The status of "accepted" items is not systematically available. This is due to the fluid, agile nature of our development cycle. Note that a backlog of accepted items is regularly reviewed and prioritized.
4. Release notes with new capabilities are published after every development cycle.
