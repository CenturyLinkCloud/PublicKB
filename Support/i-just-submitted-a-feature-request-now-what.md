## Introduction
We encourage submissions on feature requests from customers either through our [email alias](mailto:features@ctl.io) or via our [interactive portal](http://centurylinkcloud.uservoice.com/).

More details on this process is available [here](../Support/how-do-i-submit-a-feature-request.md).

### So what happens once ideas are submitted?

Here's the process.

1. Each item is reviewed by a cross-section of stakeholders, lead by our product ownership team.
2. The item is either rejected or accepted. A decision is either reached immediately, or is postponed to allow for "community" feedback based on a larger external audience.
3. The decision - and subsequent discussion - are tracked on the original thread to close the loop (either via ticket or UserVoice item).
4. The status of "accepted" items is not systematically available. This is due to the fluid, agile nature of our development cycle. Note that a backlog of accepted items is regularly reviewed and prioritized.
5. Release notes with new capabilities are published after every development cycle.
