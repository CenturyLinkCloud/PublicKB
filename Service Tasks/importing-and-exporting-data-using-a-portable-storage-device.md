If our antivirus process detects any threats or vulnerabilities, the device will be disconnected from our server and returned.  No data will be transferred from an infected device onto our network. If the device is free from viruses and malware, we will perform the import/export.

3. Our team will periodically update the ticket for this request as we progress with the work.

4. Once the data is copied and the request is completed, CenturyLink Cloud will ship the device via the pre-paid return shipping method provided.

Note that the drive will be wiped prior to return shipping if used for import.

If our team needs to apply encryption to an export, a password will be provided in the ticket.
