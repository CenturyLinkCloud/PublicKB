### Using Rackspace

If you deploy workloads to [Rackspace Cloud](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/), avoid configuring servers manually and get them running exactly the way you want consistently each time using ElasticBox. You can automatically provision or de-provision and run a sequence of commands and workflows to manage modules and applications remotely from ElasticBox. For more information, learn how [ElasticBox can solve your DevOps use cases](//www.ctl.io/elasticbox/).

In Rackspace Cloud, we manage your workloads on Linux servers, and provision and orchestrate deployments through the open source OpenStack Nova Python client.

**In this article:**
* Register Rackspace Cloud in ElasticBox
* Deploy on Rackspace Cloud from ElasticBox

### Register Rackspace Cloud in ElasticBox

You require an account on [Rackspace Cloud](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) to allow ElasticBox to execute commands and provision servers on your behalf with your credentials. We send the credentials to the Rackspace Cloud Identity Service to authenticate.

**Steps**
1. In ElasticBox, on the Providers page, click **New Provider**.
2. Select **Rackspace** and enter the credentials as shown.

* **Identity URL.** This the endpoint of the Rackspace Cloud Identity API, which authenticates access and is also the entry point to any other service API.
* **Project. **Enter the tenant ID available at the top of the username drop-down in the [Rackspace Cloud console](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/).
* **Username.** Enter the username for a user that has full access to your Rackspace Cloud account. We need it to make API requests as this user.
* **Password.** Enter the password for the user.
