### Providers
A provider is a public or private cloud account you register in ElasticBox. ElasticBox interfaces with the provider account’s API to provision and orchestrate deployments automatically. Before you can deploy workloads from ElasticBox, you need to register a provider first. ElasticBox integrates with many popular clouds. Here’s a full list of clouds ElasticBox supports and their availability by Edition:
