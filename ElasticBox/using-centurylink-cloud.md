### Using CenturyLink Cloud

Automate application deployments through ElasticBox when you launch to Linux or Windows virtual servers in the CenturyLink Cloud public cloud. ElasticBox simplifies deployments with a dedicated focus on applications rather than infrastructure.

**In this article:**

* Register CenturyLink Cloud provider in ElasticBox
* Deploy to CenturyLink Cloud from ElasticBox

### Register CenturyLink Cloud Provider in ElasticBox

You need a [CenturyLink Cloud account](//www.ctl.io/) to be able to deploy from ElasticBox. When you have an account, follow these steps to register it in ElasticBox to automate your deployments.

**Steps**

1. In ElasticBox, go to **Providers** > **New Provider** and select **CenturyLink.**
2. Enter the CenturyLink username and password as shown and save.

### Deploy to CenturyLink Cloud from ElasticBox

Select from the following deployment profile options to launch workloads on Linux or Windows machines.

Note a couple of things about instances you deploy on CenturyLink Cloud through ElasticBox.

* Instance name. Each instance is assigned a name that has the format of DatacenterFirst_six_letters_of_instance_nameCounter. i.e.: UC1CITTPUBLIC01 for an instance deployed on UC1 (US West - Santa Clara) of a box called Public Proxy.
* Instance Description. Depending on the number of instances you spin up through ElasticBox, each instance is assigned a description that has the format of dasherized-instance-name-datacenter-service_ID-machine-number.
