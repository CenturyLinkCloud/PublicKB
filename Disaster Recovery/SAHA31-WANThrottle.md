## Article Overview
This article will walk you through editing the WAN Throttle within your SafeHaven Protection Groups.  

This setting can now be controlled via the GUI, and is helpful if you need to limit the amount of replication traffic SafeHaven generates - whether during off-hours you wish increase the throttle to use more bandwidth (to decrease the overall sync time), or decrease the throttle during peak business times (which would in return slow down the replication timfeframe).

## Modifying the WAN Throttle

The WAN Throttle is set in KB/s.

1. Launch the SafeHaven Console

2. Select the correct Protection Group that you wish to modify
