### Why do we need this?
Before SafeHaven-4.0.1, the customer is required to deploy a Windows VM as a recovery proxy (aka stub) for any SafeHaven protection group (PG) that is protecting Windows servers. While this method works perfectly in the technical sense, the Windows stub incurs unnecessary Windows OS license cost, even while the stub VM is powered off in CenturyLink CLoud (CLC) for most of the time. In addition, in the ocassional event when a test failover or real failover is perfomred and the stub VMs are powered on, the Windows OS provided by CLC and paid for by the customers are not used since the stub boots into a customer disk image that is replicated by SafeHaven and Microsoft does have provisions in its licensing agreement to allow its customers to temporarily use its production Windows OS license during the short test/real failover scenarios.

An alternative method has been developed to use the open source Ubuntu-14 template which does not have any OS licensing cost in CLC. This should allow the customers to reduce cost for their SafeHaven disaster recovery solution in a significant way. This documents outlines the manual procedure that is necessary as of the SafeHaven-4.0.1 release which hopefully will soon be automated in future releases.


### 1. Information Gathering before Onboarding

We should gather information about servers to protect, for each Windows VM, we need to know its NIC model and PCI slot.
A table like this needs to be filled:

|VM Name|NIC Model|NIC PCI Slot|
|---|---|---|
|VM-1|VMXNET3|192|
|VM-2|VMXNET3|192|
|VM-3|VMXNET3|224|
|VM-4|VMXNET3|192|
...

Notes
* The method described in this document only works for the VMXNET3 NIC type. If the production VM runs E1000 or E1000E NIC type, it is highly recommended to replace them with a VMXNET3 NIC.
* If there are multiple NICs, any one of the NICs can be chosen as the match in the discovery recovery site and it does not have to be the one on production site connecting to the iSCSI target.
* SafeHavne-4 does not support recovery VMs with multiple NICs.

### 2. Create CLC Templates before Onboarding

* Get a list of unique VMXNET3 PCI Slot numbers for the production VM. For example, the above table has two unique numbers: 192 and 224.
* For each of the unique PCI Slot number that is not 160 (which is the standard CLC Ubunyu-14 template configuration)
  * Deploy a Ubuntu-14 in recovery CLC site
  * Send a ticket to help@ctl.io to change its PCI slot number from 160 to this new number that exists in production
  * Once the change is confirmed with the ```lspci -v``` conmmand, convert this VM to a template with names such as ```MakeStub Template: Ubuntu-14 on PCI Slot 192```.

### 3. Create Protection Groups during Onboarding

#### 3.1 (Available starting from  SafeHaven-4.0.1) Automatically Deploy/Configure the Recovery Proxy
This is a feature that is not yet available in SafeHaven-4.0.0.

Note that there are two ways to create a protection group and they have different methods to deploy/configure the recovery servers to boot from the proper iSCSI target.

##### 3.1.1 (Recommended) Automatically Deploy and Configure the Recovery Proxy during PG Creation

![prov_wizard_option1_conf.PNG](../../images/SH-4.0/prov_wizard_option1_conf.PNG)


When deploying a recovery proxy server in CLC in the SafeHaven GUI protection group provision wizard, we need to make sure the template created in step 2 with matching **PCI Slot** number is chosen.

Notes
* If the production VM is running on VMXNET3 NIC on PCI Slot 160, the default CLC template of ```Ubuntu 14|64bit``` should be used.
* **It is the user's responsibility to choose the proper templates**. For example, the Linux has been selected as the OS of the stub machines, the user needs to choose templates that would deploy Ubuntu-14 on proper PCI Slot.
  *  If Windows templates are chosen, the PG creation process would fail.
  *  If the OS is correct but NIC PCI slot does not match the production VM, PG creation would work but the test-failove/failover operation would fail to properly boot into the recovery server.



##### 3.1.2 (Advanced) Automatically Run Makestub for PG Created by Choosing Existing Recovery Servers
![prov_wizard_option2A.PNG](../../images/SH-4.0/prov_wizard_option2A.PNG)
On the next page, please make sure only Ubuntu-14 Linux VMs deployed from the proper templates that matches the corresponding production VM NIC model and PCI slot are chosen as recovery proxies.

Once the PG is created, the user launch the Makestbu wizard by right clicking on the PG and choose "installation->Install SafeHaven MakeStub".

Notes

* If all the recovery VMs are Windows, then this wizard will allow the user to configure them automatically using the Windows method.
* If all the recovery VMs are Linux, then this wizard will allow the user to configure them automatically using the Linux method.
* If the recovery VMs in the PG are of different OS (Windows and LINUX), the wizard would refuse to proceed and the user has no option but to manually configure them to boot from iSCSI target running the proper binary in each guest. Please refer to section 3.2 of this document.

#### 3.2 Manually Deploy from Template and Choose exsting VM as Recovery Proxy
This is the only method to be used in SafeHaven-4.0.0 if a Linux OS is to be used as the stub to protect a Windows VM.

When deploying a recovery proxy server manually in CLC, we need to make sure the template created in step 2 with matching **PCI Slot** number is chosen. Note that if the production VM is running on VMXNET3 NIC on PCI Slot 160, the default CLC template of ```Ubuntu 14|64bit``` should be used.

Once the stub VM is deployed from the chosen template, obtain the ```makestub_for_windows.sh``` by running the following commands as root:
```
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8emtxq2rt8edls/makestub_for_windows.sh
chmod +x makestub_for_windows.sh
```

##### 3.2.1 Interactively during a Test Failover: Auto iSCSI Discovery
If the iSCSI target is present (for example during the test failover), one can simply run the ```makestub_for_windows.sh``` command. An interactive interface will guide the user to 
* install necessary packages
* enter the SRN IP address
* choose the proper iSCSI target IQN found by auto discovery

An example:
```

##### 3.2.2 (Recommended) Silently: Without Test Failover

It is recommended to perform the MakeStub procedure while the production VMs are in the onboarding process. For this reason, a test failover is not possible. The IQN can be copied from the SafeHaven Console's Targets tab.

```
root@CA2SHSJSTW12-01:~# ./makestub_for_windows.sh  -d -s 10.55.220.184 -i iqn.2016-09.io.ctl:Windows-PG-Win12R2-external
