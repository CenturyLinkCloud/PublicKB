### Article Overview

This article explains how to boot from a Production VM from primary data storage after it has been configured to boot from iSCSI disks for failback. This is the last step for failback.

**NOTE**: To follow this step the user MUST have already completed Failback Phase 1 and Phase 2 covered in [Failback a Windows Protection Group](Failback a Windows Protection Group.md) KB Article

### Requirements

1. The protection group has already been Failed Back from the DR site back to its production site. The Production site is the active site now.
2. The Production server should be configured with makestub.exe to boot from the disk of the production SRN.
3. The Production Server should be successfully booted from the production SRN's disks.

### Assumptions

This article assumes that the user has already performed Failback Phase 1 and Phase 2, and the Production VM has been configured with makestub.exe and is booting from the iSCSI disks. Now the user wants to copy data from the iSCSI disks to the production VM's local disk and then boot the VM from the Primary Storage.

For the purpose of this article, we have used Windows 2012R2 as a production server in CenturyLink's CA2(Toronto) production datacenter. The recovery site being used is CenturyLink's WA1(Washington) recovery datacenter.
