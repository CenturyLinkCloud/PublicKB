### Article Overview
This article explains how to expand the size of a Protection Group. This can be useful when a user wants to expand disk size or add a new disk to an already protected VM, or add a new VM to an existing Protection Group. In either case, the first step is to expand the size of the Protection Group.

### Add storage to the Production and Recovery SRN  


### Edit Storage
Go to the Centurylink Portal, select the Production SRN and click on "Edit Storage"

Add 10% of the additional disk for local Cache and 100% for local Replica. 

* On Recovery SRN  
Add 100% of the additional disk.

Enter a value for the new raw disk and click on apply. This has to be repeated for the Recovery SRN. Once the approprite amount of storage has been added to both the production and the recovery SRNs, it needs to be claimed in the storage pool associated with the Protection Group.
