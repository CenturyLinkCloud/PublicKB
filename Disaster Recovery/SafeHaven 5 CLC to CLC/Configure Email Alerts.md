### Article Overview
This article focusses on how to configure email alerts. **This is a critical step for DR solution, failing to configure email alerts may result in customers not being notified of SafeHaven environment issues in the event of production site outage.**

### Check AWS Statistics

Before enabling the email alerts please make sure that the Protection Groups are getting clean checkpoints.

2. Fill in the information of your own SMTP server
3. Check **Use anonymous SMTP service** box (Optional)

5. Configure **Report Frequency**
5. Click on **Add email address** and type the recipient email address in the pop-up window

7. Go to recipient's mailbox and check the test email
