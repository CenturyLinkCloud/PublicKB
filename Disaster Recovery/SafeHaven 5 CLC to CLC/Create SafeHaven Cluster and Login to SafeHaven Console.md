### Article Overview
This article explains how to deploy a SafeHaven Cluster. Once the cluster is deployed, a user can log in to SafeHaven Console to access their SafeHaven Environment and start the DR setup.

### Assumptions
1. CMS server has been created
2. The CMS server is reachable from the PC/machine you are running the SafeHaven Console on.
3. The CMS server has internet access.

### Most Recent SafeHaven Release Updates
Please ensure that you are using the most recent SafeHaven release update to create a new cluster. Please refer to [Most Recent SafeHaven Release Updates](../Overview/Most-Recent-SafeHaven-Release-Updates.md) for information on what's most recent.

### Download the SafeHaven Console Application
Download the **GUI Package** from the **Download Links** section of the most recent SafeHaven release notes. In this case, it is [SafeHaven 5.0 Release Notes](../SafeHaven 5 General/SafeHaven5.0.0-Release-Notes.md). Once the file is downloaded, extract it, and run **safehaven-console.exe**.


### Create a New SafeHaven Cluster
1. Launch the **safehaven-console.exe**.
2. Click on **Create new cluster**.
3. Enter the **Organization Name** and the **License key** provided to you by your CenturyLink Onboarding Resource. Click **Next**.
4. Fill in the following fields:  

   a. Enter **CMS Hostname**.
    
   b. **CMS Access IP** (used to connect to the SafeHaven Console GUI) and **CMS Service IP** (used for communication between CMS 		and SRN's). Typically the CMS Private IP address is entered in these fields although they can differ in some cases. You can get this information from the CMS Server deployed in the recovery datacenter which is CLC in this case.

   c. Set the **Administrator Password** (Password required to login to the SafeHaven Console GUI to manage the DR environment and 	initiate recovery operations).  

   d. Enter the **CMS root password**. You can get this information from the CMS Server deployed in the recovery datacenter which 		is CLC in this case.

    **NOTE**: Best practice is to use different passwords for Administrator and root user.

   e. Click on **Validate CMS Access** to confirm connectivity to the CMS.

   f. Copy the **Debian Package for CMS/SRN** link from the **Download Links** section of the most recent SafeHaven release notes.
   In this case, it is  [SafeHaven 5.0 Release Notes](../SafeHaven 5 General/SafeHaven5.0.0-Release-Notes.md) and enter it in the **SafeHaven distribution URL** field.

   **NOTE**:Please contact your CenturyLink Cloud Onboarding Resource if you have any questions regarding the latest version of **Debian
   Package for CMS/SRN**. Do not modify the Service Port (TCP), Heartbeat Port (UDP), Installation ID.

5. Click **Next**
6. A warning message will appear.
"By clicking continue, a fresh cluster will be installed. Previous configuration will be replaced. Are you sure to continue ?" Click on **Continue**.

7. Wait for the SafeHaven software to complete the configuration of the CMS server. When this process is complete, a pop-up window appears to let you know that the configuration was successful.
8. Click **OK** and then **Finish**.

	**NOTE**: The CMS will reboot as part of the installation procedure.

### Login to the SafeHaven Console
1. Login to the **SafeHaven Console** by using the **Client Access IP address** for the CMS.
2. Enter **Administrator** in the **User** field and enter the Administrator **Password** you had set during the cluster installation procedure stated above.
3. Click **Log In**.
2. **Install** the SSL Certificate (This will require Administrator rights).
3. The **SafeHaven Cluster** will appear and you can start configuring it.
