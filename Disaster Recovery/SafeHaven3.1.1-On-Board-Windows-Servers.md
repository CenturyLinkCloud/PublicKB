### Article Overview 
We demonstrate the procedure of on-boarding Windows server by leveraging the
automated LRA installation and stub configuration introduced in SafeHaven 3.1.1
in this article. This includes pairing SRNs, claiming storage pool, protection
group creation, Local Replica Agent (LRA) installation and makestub configuraion. 

#### Pair The Two SRNs
- Highlight the PRSRN, under the Peers tabs, click **Add Peer**. 
    ![EXPAND](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-0.png)

- Select the DRSRN and enter the passwords, then click **Register**. 
    ![EXPAND](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-1.png)

- Now the two SRNs are paired.

#### Prepare Storage Pool
In this example, we are going to protect two VMs within one protection group.
The disk size is 61GB for each of VM, so in total the protection group is 122GB.
We recommend use 25% of primary storage as checkpoint pool, so the checkpoint pool is
30GB. Since this is Local Replica protection group, the storage recommended on PR
SRN is 10% of the primary storage, i.e., 12.2G. The following screenshots shows
how to claim the storage on PR SRN assuming that there is already a 100GB disk 
attached to the PR SRN node. In the same way, 200GB disk is claimed as storage
pool on DR SRN.

- Hightlight the PR SRN node, and click **Claim Storage Pool**.
    ![CLAIM-STORAGE](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-3.png)
- Select the block device and **Create a new Storage Pool**. Enter the storage
  pool name and hit **Claim**.
    ![CLAIM-STORAGE](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-4.png)
- Now go back the **Properties** panel of the SRN node, you will see a storage
  pool is created.

#### Create Protection Group
- Right Click on PR SRN and select **Create Protection Group**.
![CREATE-PG](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-6.png)
- Select DRSRN as remote SRN and choose **I want to protect virtual machine(s)**.
![CREATE-PG](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-7.png)
- Browse the VM list on vCenter and select the vApp.
![CREATE-PG](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-8.png)
- Enter the information for deploying stubs. 
  - Choose CLC server folder.
  - Enter the Alias and Proxy Tempalte for each of the stub.
  - Select CLC VLAN for the stub.
  - Enter the Administrator password for the stubs. 
![CREATE-PG](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-9.png)
- Review the protection group name and protected servers. 
![CREATE-PG](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-10.png)
- Enter the local cache and select storage pools on both SRNs. 
![CREATE-PG](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-11.png)
- Review the PG information and click **Finish**.
![CREATE-PG](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-12.png)
- After the PG is created.

#### Install Local Replica Agent and Start Replication
The automated LRA installation is a experimental feature. It requires that the
guest VM OS to be Windows 2008 R2 or later. Also port TCP 445 has to open on
guest VMs. 

- Right click on the PG and select **Install SafeHaven Local Replication
  Agent**.
  ![Install-LRA](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-14.png)
- Enter the guest VMs username, password, URL of download LRA and the IP
  addresses of protected VM. Please ensure the IP addresses entered match the
  source VM.
  ![Install-LRA](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-15.png)
- After ten minutes or so, the replication has been started. Please see the
  following screeshot, the Un-synchronized data begin to accumulate. 
  ![Install-LRA](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-16.png)
- Verify every protected VM in the PG is connected to the iSCSI target and the
  replication has started on each of the VM.

#### Configure Stub

Automated stub configuration procedure powers on the stubs, installs the
makestub.exe and configures the stubs to boot from the right target, at last it
powers off the stubs. This step has to be done before the Test-Failover. The stubs has to be Windows 2008 R2 or later and TCP 445 port is
required to open. Please also match the NIC type and PCI number of the stubs
with the guest VMs. 

- Right clich the PG and select **Install SafeHaven MakeStub**.
 ![Install-Makestub](../images/SH3.1.1Onboarding-Windows/SH3.1.1-Onboarding-Windows-18.png)
- Enter the stub usernamee, password, URL of downloading the makestub.exe and
  the IP addresses of stubs. Please make sure the IP addresses entered match the
  source VM name. For example, in the following screenshot, 10.55.220.149 is
  stub ip which matches to source VM App2. After configure makestub, stub with
  this ip is the recovery VM for App2.
