##### PREFACE:
This document will walk you through manually adding additional SRN appliances to a pre-existing cluster, and then pairing the SRNs with their DR replication partners within the Recovery Data Center. Note that SRNs can replicate to multiple other SRNs in different groups, vlans or data centers using the procedure below. This document covers the procedure for 3.0 and 3.1.

##### ADD NEW SRN’s TO A PRE-EXISTING CLUSTER IN 3.0

  1. Deploy the SRN and match its code to the cluster code.
  1. In the SafeHaven Console, Right Click on the Site and Add click on “Register SRN”.
  1. Enter the Information asked and register the SRN from the GUI.
  1. SSH as “Administrator” into the CMS (Administrator password is the SafeHaven Cluster password)
  1. cd /usr/lib/datagardens/BaseImageConfigurators
  1. CMS: Run ./addSRN script like below for each SRN that is added:

  For example:

  ```sh
  Administrator@VA1XXXXCMS01:cd /usr/lib/datagardens/BaseImageConfigurators/
  BaseImageConfigurators$: ./addSRN VA1RXXXXSRN02 10.135.25.20 10.135.25.20 10.135.25.20 CLC 20082

  ```

  The command syntax is ./addSRN SRNHOSTNAME "Service_IP" "Storage_IP" "WAN_Sync_IP" "Type of Connection" "Connection_Port"

  The connection port default is 20082. The options for "Type of connection" can be CLC, VMWARE, VPDC, VCLOUD, MANUAL or CUSTOM. Most cases will either be CLC or VMWARE/VCLOUD (if using vCD).

  1. Test password-less ssh access from Administrator@CMS to root@SRN

##### PAIRING SRNs (CREATE PEERS)

1. CMS: Run ./pair2SRNs.sh script once for each SRN pair:

For example:
```sh
Administrator@VA1XXXXCMS01:/usr/lib/datagardens/BaseImageConfigurators$ ./pair2SRNs.sh

syntax: ./pair2SRNs.sh <SRN1 Service IP> <SRN1 Storage IP> <SRN1 Root Password> <SRN2 Service IP> <SRN2 Storage IP> <SRN2 Root Password>

Note: this should be run as Administrator and the SRNs should already have been added to the cluster
Exit

Administrator@VA1CA6SHCMS01:/usr/lib/datagardens/BaseImageConfigurators$ ./pair2SRNs.sh 10.230.102.192 10.230.102.192 ABC123!! 10.135.25.20 10.135.25.20 ABC123!!

finish with success

```

Finally, test password-less root ssh access between all the SRN pairs.

##### ADD NEW SRN’s TO A PRE-EXISTING CLUSTER IN 3.1

  1. Right-click your Data Center and choose "Register SRN" and fill out the IP address/password fields.
  2. Once the SRN has been registered, highlight the partner SRN and navigate to the "Peers" tab.
  3. Click "Add Peer"
  4. Choose the appropriate peers from the dropdown menu and enter the passwords, and click "Register"
