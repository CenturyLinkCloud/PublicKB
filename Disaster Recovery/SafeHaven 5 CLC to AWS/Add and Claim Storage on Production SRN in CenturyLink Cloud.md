### Article Overview
This article explains how to attach storage on a single SRN in CenturyLink Cloud. After the SRN has been registered with the SafeHaven Console, the next step is to attach storage to it before creating Protection Groups.

**NOTE**: For ease of management and troubleshooting it is recommended that the user creates one Storage Pool per Protection Group.

### Requirements
1. Access to the Production SRN in CenturyLink Cloud portal
2. Access to the SafeHaven Cluster

### Assumptions
This article assumes that the user has already registered the SRN within the SafeHaven Console and wants to add storage to the SRN before creating Protection Groups.

### Add storage to the Production SRN in CenturyLink Cloud
1. Login to CLC Control portal https://control.ctl.io, select **Servers** under the **Infrastructure** tab. Confirm the Storage requirements for the Production Server (in this case Windows). Based on the Production Server O.S. Type and [Storage Requirements](Determine Storage Requirements.md), calculate the amount of storage that needs to be added.

2. In the Navigation Tree, select the **SRN** you want to add storage to, then scroll down on the main data panel and select **edit storage**.
3. Select **add storage** and then in the drop-down menu select **raw disk**.
   **NOTE**: **DO NOT** select a **partitoned** disk.

4. Add required storage and **apply**. Wait for the job to complete.

**NOTE**: There is no need to allocate storage for the SRN in AWS or Azure, depending on the size of your Protection Group SafeHaven will automatically create the volumes to meet the requirements.

### Claim storage pool for CenturyLink Cloud Production SRN
1. Once the storage has been attached to the SRN, the next step is to login to the **SafeHaven Console**.
2. Go to the Navigation Tree and select the Production SRN. In the **Properties Panel** select **Claim Storage Pool**.
**NOTE**: If you don't see a device listed click on **Rescan** in order to force a rescan of the SCSI bus on the SRN.

3. If this is the first storage device you are claiming, then select the Storage Device you want to claim and select **Create a New Storage Pool for the Device**. Fill in the **Storage Pool Name** and click **Claim**.

4. Depending on the protection group architecture, the user can claim another disk following a similar procedure and can either **Create a new Storage Pool** or **Add to an existing Storage Pool**.
