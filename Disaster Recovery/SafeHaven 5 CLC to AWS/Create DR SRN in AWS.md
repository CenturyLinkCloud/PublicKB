### Article Overview
This article explains how to create a SRN (SafeHaven Replication Node) in AWS DR Datacenter.

### Requirements
1. User must have an AWS account and permissions to deploy a server in the DR subnet.
2. Internet access on DR-SRN in AWS once it is deployed.

### Assumptions
1. It is assumed here that the user has an AWS account and a VPC created which has accessibility to CenturyLink Cloud Production Datacenter.
2. Typically CMS and DR-SRN reside in the same subnet so we will simply re-use the Security Group we created in the previous step [Create CMS in AWS](Create CMS in AWS.md)

### Create an AWS instance
1. Go to **Services** > **EC2**
2. Click on **Launch Instance**.
3. Select **Community AMIs**, and search for **SafeHaven**. Select **SafeHaven-5 Base OS**.
4. Select **m4.large** resource type, and click on **Next:Configure Instance Details**.
5. Select a subnet on your VPC which has reachability to CLC Production datacenter. Rest of the options can be left as default. Click **Next:Add Storage**
6. Proceed with default 30GB storage and Make sure that Volume type is **General Purpose SSD(GP2)**.
7. Click **Next: Add Tags**.
8. Click **Next: Configure Security Group**. Click on **Select existing Security Group**. Select the pre-existing security group that was created during [Create CMS in AWS](Create CMS in AWS.md) setup.
9. Click on **Review and Launch**.
10. Click on **Launch**.
11. Select **Proceed without a key pair** and click on the checkbox **"I acknowledge that I will not ..."**
12. Click on **Launch Instances**.
13. Once the Instance is created, user can name the instance as CMS and add tags if required.

**NOTE:** The default root password for the SRN will be provided upon SafeHaven License Request. **It is STRONGLY recommended to change the default root password for security purposes.**
