### Overview:
This document instruct engineers on updating minor released of SafeHaven deployments. Note that major releases (i.e. 3.0 to 3.1) require a complete rebuilt and re-replication of all data.

### Code Version Check
1. Check the current version of the code.

2. ssh as root into the SafeHaven Nodes
   * For SRN’s : In the root directory.
     * Run "cat sbd_version".
  * For SRN and CMS: cd /usr/lib/datagardens
    * Run "cat syntropy_version".
    * Run "cat "utils_version".
    * Run "cat cms_version".

4. Kill the services.
   * ssh as root into the CMS:
     * run killall -9 manager
     * run ps aux |grep manager to make sure manager is not running anymore
   * ssh as root into the SRN:
     * run killall -9 voffice
     * run ps aux |grep voffice to make sure voffice is not running anymore

### Update the Code
1. UPDATE THE SYNTROPY ON THE SAFEHAVEN NODES (CMS and SRN)
    ssh as root into the Nodes:

2. SYNTROPY AND UTILS UPDATE: (NO REBOOT REQUIRED)
   * (.i.e., wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/77jqlocmn12e94b/SafeHaven3.0.1u9_nosbd_05-07-2015_bin.tar.gz?dl=0). Please verify link correspond to the release you are updating.

3. Get the latest syntropy and utils code from dropbox (same as above, ensure that the download matches your release).
   * Run "tar xvfz SafeHaven3.0.1u9_nosbd_05-07-2015_bin.tar.gz?dl=0 –C /" for each binary
   * UPDATE THE SBD ON THE SRN’s (SRN REBOOT REQUIRED - NOT DONE ALWAYS).

### Kernel Version Check
1. ssh as root into the SRN.

2. Check the kernel version on the SRN’s:
   * Run “uname –r” or “uname -a”.
   * The kernel version needs to be 3.13.0-44-generic. Update/downgrade the Kernel Version to 3.13.0-44-generic (apt-get remove linux-kernal-3.13.0-55-generic (or -48-generic) or apt-get install linux-headers-3.13.0-44-generic).
   * Reboot the SRN
   * Run “uname –r” or “uname -a” and verify the kernel version again.
   * NOTE: If the kernel version is later than 3.13.0-44-generic, downgrade it to 3.13.0-44-generic.

### SBD Update
1. Get the latest sbd code from dropbox.
   * wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/knr87xj7s2ik8j1/sbd2_cowonly_13485_kernel_3.13.0-44-generic_bin.tar.gz?dl=0
   * tar xvzf sbd2_cowonly_13056_kernel_3.13.0-44-generic_bin.tar.gz?dl=0 -C /

2. Reboot.
   * Confirm and make sure the sbd can be loaded by running “sbdm version”.

3. Install SCST Services.
   * Get the baseInstaller from dropbox, if it is not there already.
   * wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/ka3c4kb20ybth95/baseInstaller-3.0.1u1.tar.gz?dl=0
   * tar xvfz baseInstaller-3.0.1u1.tar.gz?dl=0
   * cd /baseInstaller/ scst/scst-3.0.0-Ubuntu1404# ./scst_install.sh
   * cd /baseInstaller/scst/scst-3.0.0-Ubuntu1404# service scst restart
   * Confirm scst is working by running “scstadmin –list_target”

### Final Steps:
1. Log in to the CMS.
   * You will be prompted to restart the services before successful login occurs.

2. Once in CMS, restart any stopped SRN services.

3. Verify release version by running "cat /var/syntropy" and "cat /var/utils_version" on each updated SRN and "cat /var/cms_version" on the CMS.

4. Final install Note- the same steps can be completed in a single command by running the same process and untarring the full kernel for the new release rather than running SBD/Syntropy especially. This applies to minor releases, in which bug fixes are more likely to be centered around either component (i.e., using https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7nkdp0t6uga02k/AACDB_ZwEOLkVGjVkcPumHKSa/SafeHaven3.1.0-GA_full_kernel-3.13.0-44-generic_06-26-2015_bin.tar.gz?dl=0)

RE-CONFIRM THE VERSION OF SYNTROPY AND SBD AGAIN

NOTE: SRN REBOOT CAN HAVE A SERIOUS IMPACT ON THE CUSTOMER’S ENVIRONMENT SO IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO PLEASE CONFIRM WITH THE DATAGARDENS TEAM BEFORE REBOOTING THE SRN’s (AT LEAST FOR NOW).

NOTE: DO NOT USE THE DROPBOX LINKS MENTIONED IN THIS DOCUMENT, these are sample 3.0 links. Please check with the SafeHaven/Onboarding team prior to completing this action and do so under strict guidance (though taking a snapshot prior will mitigate any potential risk).

IMPORTANT NOTE: it is very important to run an update-grub command after upgrading/downloading kernels as the scstadmin services are tied to the kernal number and will not function properly if not updated and then rebooted.
