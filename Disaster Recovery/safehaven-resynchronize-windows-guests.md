### Article Overview
Sometimes, due to impromper error states or corruption, it can be necessary to resychronize Production data. Rather than rebuilding the protection group, there is an easy way to accomplish this using the built-in SafeHaven "Tools" prompt.

### Detailed Steps

1. Open the "Tools" prompt under the Start Menu-> "SafeHaven DRaaS..." folder.

2. Open the DgSyncEx.exe prompt by typing `DgSyncEx.exe` and hitting enter (typing dgs and hitting tab should also auto-complete the command).

3. In the DgSyncEx prompt, type `select disk 0`

4. Type `set progress 0`

5. Repeat for disk 1, 2 or any other remaining Production disk (note that one does not select the replica iSCSI disks).

6. Type `sync report` for a detailed view of the resynchronization progress (or `DgSyncEx.exe sync report` if prompt exited). When all disks have hit 100%, confirm they are in a clean state by issueing the `list` command from the prompt or `DgSyncEx.exe list` in a new tools prompt.
