### Overview

If there is corruption within a Protection Group (see companion article on determining corruption), or other issues within the cluster, occasionally a Test-Failover clone will fail and require manual cleanup. The following commands will walk you through removing the clone and protection group. They will need to be completely re-created once they have been removed, as a corrupt Protection Group is unusable.

### Walkthrough

1. Stop CMS and SRN services
  1. Log in CMS, run the following commands
	2. Kill the process: `killall -9 manager`
	3. Make sure the process is killed with the command: `ps -ef|grep manager`

2. Log into Prod SRNx and DR SRNx
  1. Login to both SRNs
  2. Kill the process: `killall -9 voffice`
	3. Make sure the process is killed with the command: `ps -ef|grep voffice`
	4. Repeat on all nodes.

3. Clean the target
  1. Run `scstadmin -list_target`
  2. Copy the desied IQN     
	3. Run `scstadmin -rem_target <pasted IQN name> -driver iscsi`

4. Clean the device 		
  1. `vgs` to list all volume groups
	2. `vgchange -a n <vg name>`
	3. `vgremove <vg name> -f`

5. `kpartx -d /dev/sbdx` (where x is the number of your PG SBD group, found either through CMS GUI or following the steps below)
    1. login to srn
    2. `cd /var/syntropy/dvol`
    3. `ls`
    4. `cat protectiongroupname/protectiongroup.dvol`
    5. `ms_sbd_device to get /dev/sbd#`

6. `sbdm /dev/sbdx clear` (where x is the number of the PG SBD group)

7. Clean Logical Volume
	1. `lvs` to list
	2. If yes, then
	3. `lvremove:/dev/$volumegroupname$ $(Storage Pool Name$)/$protection group name$`

    *(Most will have a snap volume and a PG volume so it is easiest to do lvremove /dev/vol group/PG-name* and you will be prompted to choose y/n for each volume in the event of a mistake.)*

  4.OPTIONAL COMMAND (Not currently required): dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<volume group name>/<protection group name> bs=4M

8. Clean Physical Volumes
	1. pvs to list
	2. If volumes exist, then execute
	3. `pvremove /dev/mapper/xxx`

9. Clean the folders and files
	1. `cd /var/syntropy/`
	2. `ls`
	3. cd into every directory, delete any files with the PG name  (associated bitmaps, pluns, targets, dvol. Some of these will be directories so use rm -rf rather than simply rm). If you have a unique name, it is easiest to cd into each directory ane simply `rm -rf <Protection Group Name*>` and then re-run `ls` to verify that the appropriate entries have been deleted.

  10. Login to CMS and re-start services when prompted to. Manually restart SRN services (right click on SRN, "start") and then rebuild Protection Groups as required.
