### Release Notes

- SafeHaven Version: 5.2.0
- Release Date: June 13, 2019

### New Features and Enhancements
This is new minor released based on [SafeHaven 5.1.5](SafeHaven5.1.5-Release-Notes.md) with the following improvements:
- New SafeHaven Replication Node (SRN) Linux kernel module for WAN replication (SBD) that fixes a rare data corruption case
- New SRN base package that 
  - uses an updated version of the Ansible library for automated driver installation or makestub
  - improves the sbd log rotation
- Bug fix where a local replica protection group data replication does not resume automatically upon network interruption  

### Upgrade Path
* Upgrade from SafeHaven-4 to SafeHaven-5 will be a fresh new installation.
* SafeHaven-5.0.1 and SafeHaven-5.1.* can be upgraded to 5.2.0 using the GUI but the SRN kernel and base package needs manual upgrade
  * Note that even though it is possible to just upgrade the debian package using the GUI without updating the kernel and base package, it is highly recommended to update the kernel and base package to benefit from the bug fix and also avoid complications on technical support
  * It is recommended that customers obtain help from the SafeHaven support team to perform the kernel and base package upgrade. Please create tickets via help@ctl.io
  * Only **expert** users may follow this [Upgrade procedure for SafeHaven 5.2.0](SafeHaven5.2.0-Release-Notes.md) on their own
