### Release Notes

- SafeHaven Version: 5.2.3
- Release Date: March 4, 2020

### New Features and Enhancements

This is patch release based on [SafeHaven 5.2.2](SafeHaven5.2.2-Release-Notes.md) with the following improvements:

- Improved the cluster status report
- Improved long term network performance by recreating tunnels upon every checkpoint
- Added features needed by the [CAM DR product](../../Cloud Application Manager/DR Readiness/Enable DR.md)

### Upgrade Path

* Upgrade from SafeHaven-4 to SafeHaven-5 will be a fresh new installation.
* SafeHaven-5.0.1 and SafeHaven-5.1.* can be upgraded to 5.2.3 using the GUI but the SRN kernel and base package needs manual upgrade
  * Note that even though it is possible to just upgrade the debian package using the GUI without updating the kernel and base package, it is highly recommended to update the kernel and base package to benefit from the bug fix and also avoid complications on technical support
  * It is recommended that customers obtain help from the SafeHaven support team to perform the kernel and base package upgrade. Please create tickets via help@ctl.io
  * Only **expert** users may follow this [Upgrade procedure for SafeHaven 5.2](SH-5.1-Upgrade-5.2.md) on their own
* SafeHaven-5.2.* can be upgraded to 5.2.3 using the GUI.
