### Release Notes

- SafeHaven Version: 5.0.0
- Release Date: December 29, 2017

### New Features and Enhancements
#### New Use Case: Use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a Disaster Recovery Site

One of the major feature's of this release is the capability to protect production servers on **multiple hypervisors** and failover to **AWS**. Examples of validated hypervisors are:
* VMware: including VMware based cloud platforms such as CenturyLink Cloud, DCC-F(vCloud Director), etc.
* Hyper-V Generation 1
* Xen(AWS)
* KVM
* Physical servers: all the available baremetal servers provided by CLC have been validated

**NOTE**: Please refer to [SafeHaven-5.0-Use-Case-and-Support-Matrix](SafeHaven-5.0-Use-Case-and-Support-Matrix.md) for more information on all the use cases and support matrix.

#### Microsoft Virtual Shadow Copy (VSS) Enabled Checkpoints
Another major feature is the introduction of Microsoft Virtual Shadow Copy (VSS) enabled checkpoint for single Windows server protection groups.

**NOTE**:This feature is available for both recovery into AWS as well as CenturyLink Cloud (CLC).

#### Built-in network isolation capability via GUI
Introduced built-in network isolation capability via GUI for recovery servers running on the same subnet as the recovery SRN.

**NOTE**:This feature is ONLY available for use cases where the recovery site is CenturyLink Cloud (CLC).

### Upgrade Path
This is the first major release in the SafeHaven-5 product line and there is no upgrade path from any previous SafeHaven versions. Even the appliances (CMS/SRN) used in previous versions cannot be reused in SafeHaven-5 since it uses Ubuntu-16.04 as the base OS for the first time (in comparision, SafeHaven-4 uses Ubuntu-14.04 as the base OS).

**NOTE**: Upgrade from SafeHaven-4 to SafeHaven-5 will be a fresh new installation.
