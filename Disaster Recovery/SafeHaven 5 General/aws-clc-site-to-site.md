### Article Overview
This article explains how to create a site-to-site VPN between AWS and CLC. It is assumed that the user has accounts in both AWS and CLC in order to create the VPN.

### Create VPC  
1. Login to your AWS Console.

2. Go to **Services**. Click on VPC.

3. Click on **Launch VPC Wizard**  

4. Select **VPC with Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN Access**. Click **Select**.     
   * Enter **IPv4 CIDR block** . This is going to be a /16 IP block that will be created under the VPC.   
     **IPv6 CIDR Block** : Select the defaul option, **No IPv6 CIDR Block**.  
     Enter **VPC name**.  
       
   * Enter **Public subnet's IPv4 CIDR**. Enter a /24 IP block to use for the public subnet. This subnet should be within the range of        /16 IP clock specied in step a.  
     Select an **availability zone** for the subnet. 
     Enter the **Public subnet name**
       
   * Enter **Private subnet's IPv4 CIDR**. Enter a /24 IP block to use for the private subnet. This subnet should be within the range        of /16 IP clock specied in step a.  
     Select an **availability zone** for the subnet.   
     Enter the **Private subnet name**.
     
   * Click **Next**.
     
5. Configure your VPN.  
   * Enter **Customer Gateway IP**.   
     To find this information, login to [Centurylink Portal](https://control.ctl.io/)   
     Click on **Network** > **Site-to-site VPN**  
     Click **+site to site vpn**  
     Select the right datacenter in front of **Control portal site**  
     Copy the **VPN Peer IPv4 address** and paste it in **Customer Gateway IP** in AWS.
   
   * Enter **Customer Gateway name** and **VPN Connection name**.  
   
   * Change **Routing type** to **Static**
   
   * Go back to CLC **Site to Site VPN** page to get the **IP prefix**.
     Click on **Add Network Block**. Select the **Network** and **subnet size**. click **Add network block**.
     Copy the IP address in fron of **Tunnel Encrypted Subnets** and paste it under **IP prefix** in AWS.  
      
   * Click **Create VPC**. This will initiate the VPC.
   
   * Click **ok**  
     Select the newly created VPC.
     click **VPN Connections**.  
     At the bottom left of the screen. Under tunnel details you can see the 2 tunnels created. The status will be down because CLC side      of the tunnel has not been configured yet

### Continue the VPN Configuration on CLC
1. Go back to the site-to-site VPN page in CLC cloud.

2. Enter **Site Name** and **Device Name**(can be any name).  

   **VPN Peer IPv4 Address** will the outside IP of tunnel 1 under AWS Tunnel details.  

3. **Tunnel Encrypted Subnets** : Click **Add network block**. This is the private subnet from the AWS VPC. Go back to the AWS cloud, and click on **Subnets** on the left side under **Virtual Private Cloud**.  

   Select the Private subnet under new VPC, and copy the **IPv4 CIDR** from under Summary. Go back to CLC page and paste this IP under      Tunnel encrypted subnets.   

4. Click **next: phase 1**   

#### Phase 1
1. Go back to AWS page, and click on **VPN Connections**. Click **Download Configuration**. Change the vendor to **pfsense** and click **Download**. From the configuration file, you can find all the AWS VPN configuration values. Make sure you copy the configuration for Tunnel 1 and not Tunnel 2.  

2. Copy the **pre-shared key** from the file and paste it in CLC in fron of **Pre-Shared Key**. Scroll down and click on **next: phase 2**

#### Phase 2  
1. You can keep the default values:  
**IPEC Protocol** ESP  
**Encryption Algorithm**: AES-128   
**Hashing Algorithm**: SHA1(96)    
**PFS Enabled**: ON, Group 2  
**Lifetime Value**: 1 hour  

2. Click **Finish**.  

3. Wait for the VPN job to finish, you can monitor the job by clicking on Status.  

4. Go back to AWS page, click on **VPN connections**. The first tunnel should now be **UP**.  

### NAT Gateway.
The private subnet needs to be routed using a NAT Gateway.

#### Elastic IP
1. Click on **Elastic IPs** on the left side onder **Virtual Private Cloud**.  

2. Click on **Allocate new address**.  Click **Alocate**  

3. This will privision a new Elastic IP. Click **Close**. 

#### Create a NAT Gateway
1. Click on **NAT Gateways** on the left side.  

2. For **Subnet**, select the public subnet that was created with the VPC.  

3. For **Elastic IP Allocation ID**, Select the elastic IP that we created in previous section.  

4. Click **Create a NAT Gateway**

#### Edit Route Tables
1. Click **Edit route tables**.  

2. Select the route table with 0 associated subnets and the VPC that we created.  

3. Click on **Routes** tab.  

4. Click **Edit**.  

5. Click **Add another route**.  
   Under **destination**, enter 0.0.0.0/0. Undedr **target**, select the NAT Gateway created in previous section.  
   Click **Save**.  
   
6. Click on **Subnet Associations** tab.  

7. Click **Edit**.  

8. Select the private subnet, and click **Save**.  

This concludes the setup of VPN between Centurylink Cloud and AWS cloud.
