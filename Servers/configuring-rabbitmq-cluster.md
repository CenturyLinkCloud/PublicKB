<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Message queuing services do play an increasingly important role allowing companies to create elastic, cross platform/cross application, asynchronous processing architectures. One of the popular choices for message queuing is RabbitMQ, it is an Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMPQ) compliant, well documented, with a broad user base.</p>
<p>The steps below are describing how to build operational highly available redundant RabbitMQ cluster, which will be composed from three servers. The assumption is that clustered servers are residing within a same Data Center. 
	RabbitMQ replication across WAN will function, however will conflict with the principles of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP Theorem</a>.</p>

<p>Upon RabbitMQ cluster installation a testing method will be presented as well.</p>

<h3>Steps to Configure RabbitMQ Cluster on CenturyLink Cloud</h3>


<div>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Create Server.</strong>

We will use the Ubuntu 14 64-bit template for this example, however with a few changes, these steps can be performed on other OS flavours as well.<br><br>

<br>
	 	<li><strong>Install RabbitMQ.</strong>

This will become a main queue server. We will use the following script to install the MySQL package using Ubuntu's package manager. You could also create a  [blueprint script](https://t3n.zendesk.com/entries/20348448-Blueprints-Script-and-Software-Package-Management) to do this, but since we are only installing on one server for now, we will logon to the server and run the commands manually.

<pre>
apt-get update
apt-get -y install rabbitmq-server
</pre>
		<li><strong>Clone server.</strong>
<br>
Now we will use clone method to create second and third messaging queue servers.

<br>

		<li><strong>Configuring RabbitMQ cluster.</strong>

To simplify instructions, we will rename hostnames to something less cryptic, and call servers: queue1, queue2 and queue3, by executing following command on respective host.

<pre>
FIRST_SERVER$ hostname queue1 
SECOND_SERVER$ hostname queue2 
THIRD_SERVER$ hostname queue3
</pre>

We'll need to change /etc/hosts file as well to reflect the change across all nodes:

<pre>
10.XX.XX.1 queue1 # master 
10.XX.XX.2 queue2 # First slave 
10.XX.XX.3 queue3 # Second slave
</pre>

To begin cluster configuration we will stop RabbitMQ on all three servers with:

<pre>
/etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server stop
</pre>

Ensure service is stopped properly by examining output from the command - no services should be listed:

<pre>
ps aux | grep '[r]abbitmq-server'
</pre>

Since we need the same cookie file to be present across all nodes, next we need to copy the cookie from the master to slaves. Running from the master:

<pre>
scp /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie queue1:/var/lib/rabbitmq/ scp /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie queue2:/var/lib/rabbitmq/
</pre>

Make sure you start nodes after copying the cookie from the master.

<pre>
/etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server start
</pre>

The following commands have to be run on all nodes, except the master (queue1).

<pre>
rabbitmqctl stop_app
rabbitmqctl reset 
rabbitmqctl join_cluster 
rabbit@queue1 rabbitmqctl start_app
</pre>

To confirm the change took place, we check cluster's status from any connected node:

<pre>
rabbitmqctl cluster_status


Cluster status of node rabbit@queue3 ...

[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@queue1,rabbit@queue2,rabbit@queue3]}]},

{running_nodes,[rabbit@queue1,rabbit@queue2,rabbit@queue3]},

{partitions,[]}]

...done.
</pre>

<li><strong>HA policy</strong>

Finaly, to synck all the queues accross all the nodes we need to run:

<pre>
rabbitmqctl set_policy ha-all "" '{"ha-mode":"all","ha-sync-mode":"automatic"}'
</pre>

</ol>
Our cluster has been successfully created.

<h3>Testing RabbitMQ cluster</h3>

The cluster is ready to be tested. We will create a simple testing scenario to make sure our cluster works as is expected. Using first Python script we are going to submit a message to the messaging queue and using second script we will collect that message. 
To prepare for testing, we will install Python module to work with RabbitMQ:

<pre>
apt-get install python-pika
</pre>

Now let's copy and paste the following script in your home directory, and call it "test_send.py"

<pre>
import pika

queue_server='queue1'

queue_name="My_First_Queue"

message="Hello CLC!"

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=queue_server))

channel = connection.channel()

channel.queue_declare(queue='%s' % queue_name)

channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='%s' % queue_name, body='%s' % message)

print " [---->] Sent a message : '%s'" % message

connection.close()
</pre>

The script connects to the "queue1" servers and sends a message, which consecutively replicates into the rest of the servers of our new queue cluster:

<pre>
python test_send.py
</pre>

To make sure message has been successfully received, we run:

<pre>
rabbitmqclt list_queues
</pre>

When we run this command on each of the three clustered servers, you should see:

<pre>
queue1:/home/rabbit/py$ rabbitmqctl list_queues

Listing queues ...

My_First_Queue 1

...done.

queue2:/home/rabbit/py$ rabbitmqctl list_queues

Listing queues ...

My_First_Queue 1

...done.

queue3:/home/rabbit/py$ rabbitmqctl list_queues

Listing queues ...

My_First_Queue 1

...done.
</pre>

Output from the command implies that message is waiting in a queue to be used. To test message retrieval, we'll use the following script test_receive.py

<pre>
import pika

queue_name="My_First_Queue"

queue_server="queue2"

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(queue_server))

channel = connection.channel()

channel.queue_declare(queue='%s' % queue_name)

def callback(ch, method, properties, body):

print " [---->] Received %r" % (body,)

channel.basic_consume(callback,

queue='%s' % queue_name,

no_ack=True)

print ' [---->] Waiting for the next messages. To exit press CTRL+C'

channel.start_consuming()
</pre>

The script connects to one of the cluster nodes and retrieves the message stored there.

<pre>
queue3:/home/rabbit/py$ python test_receive.py

[---->] Received 'Hello CLC!'

[---->] Waiting for the next messages. To exit press CTRL+C
</pre>

We received our message and can confirm that messaging queue becomes empty:

<pre>
queue1:/home/rabbit/py$ rabbitmqctl list_queues

Listing queues ...

My_First_Queue 0

...done.
</pre>
