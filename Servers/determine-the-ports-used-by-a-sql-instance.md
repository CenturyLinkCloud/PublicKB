### OVERVIEW
It is common knowledge that the default SQL instance uses port 1433. However, when SQL server hosts multiple instances, or a custom port is being used, communication problems can arise. There are two easy ways to determine which ports are being used by a given SQL instance.

### METHOD ONE: SQL Query/Stored procedure
1. Execute the following SQL Query (if one-off) or as a stored procedure (if executing multiple times)

    ![Query](../images/determine-the-ports-used-by-a-sql-instance-01.png)

2. The output should appear with the ports listed:

    ![Query Result](../images/determine-the-ports-used-by-a-sql-instance-02.png)

    In this instance, port 61737 is being used.


### METHOD TWO: SQL Configuration Manager

1. Open "SQL Configuration Manager"

2. Expand "SQL Server Network Configurations" and select "Protocols for "INSTANCE NAME"

3. In the right pane, right-click on "TCP/IP" and select "Properties".

4. Choose the "IP Addresses" tab, and the port will be shown at the bottom:

    ![SQL PORT](../images/determine-the-ports-used-by-a-sql-instance-03.png)
