<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>The CenturyLink Cloud platform provides a simple, self-service action to extend existing Windows Disks as storage utilization grows on Virtual Servers. By leveraging the Control Portal automation customers can easily, via a single click, expand
  disk sizes up to the <a href="https://t3n.zendesk.com/entries/21819996-Cloud-Server-Instance-Size-and-Performance">platform maximums</a>.</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CenturyLink Cloud Users</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 2008 or Windows 2012 Operating System</li>
  <li>The administrator password stored in the Control Portal (Administrative Credentials) must match the Operating System administrator password for automated diskpart functions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Legacy Windows 2003 Operating Systems require the use of extpart or other 3rd party tools to extend partitions. Customers are responsible for extending partitions in the Operating System for Windows 2003 and downloading the proper tools to accomplish
    this task.</li>
  <li>The Control Portal does not permit reductions in drive sizes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>1. Navigate to the Virtual Server in the Server menu. The Server UI will detail the current disk sizes and driver letters assigned to the Virtual Server. Quick Tip: &nbsp;Make note of the Disk ID and the Partition Path you want to extend.
