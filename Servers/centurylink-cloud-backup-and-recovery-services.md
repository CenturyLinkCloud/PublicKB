### Overview
Data is the lifeblood of any organization—and keeping that data safely backed up and accessible in the event of file corruption is crucial. On top of that, organizations have different data retention policies that govern how long certain types of information should be backed up and where it should be physically hosted.  Customers easily backup and restore data with a wide range of [CenturyLink Cloud](//www.ctl.io) and [Marketplace Provider Program Partners.](//www.ctl.io/marketplace/program/)

### [Simple Backup Service](//www.ctl.io/simple-backup-service/)
For servers running in the public cloud, Simple Backup Service offers the ultimate in reliability and convenience. Just point-and-click to create backup policies that meet your requirements, then apply them to servers in the CenturyLink Cloud.

From there, Simple Backup Service does the rest for you—data is automatically backed up in secure object storage and retained according to the policy. Restores are simple too—just click on a “point-in-time” backup event, and the data will be automatically restored within minutes.

**Peace of Mind Reliability & Security**
* The Simple Backup Service “just works”—backup operations are completely automated. Data is transferred from your server to secure object storage over the Internet. The backups are stored for as long as you specify.
* Restores are simple—just select the point-in-time backup you want to restore from, click and it’s done.
* Data in transit between the client and the backup infrastructure uses a secure TLS (transport layer security) connection. All backups are fully encrypted for storage and decrypted upon restore.

**Comply with Enterprise Data Retention Policies**
* Create and apply policies for data retention that match common corporate guidelines.
* Customize every aspect of your data backups—including location, frequency of backup, and retention period.
* Supports data sovereignty, with backup sites in the US, Canada, the EU and APAC.
* Store data for as long as required—days, month, or years.

**Flexible & Easy to Use**
* The Simple Backup Service is integrated with the Control Portal, and API accessible.
* Point-and-click to install the backup agent—no need to SSH or RDP to get started.
* Pay-as-you-go billing—estimates of charges for the service are included in the Control Portal as well.
* Keep backups efficient, by specifying only the file paths you need. Only files in those paths will be backed up. Configure folders to exclude as well.
* Supports both virtual machines and Bare Metal cloud servers on the CenturyLink Platform.
