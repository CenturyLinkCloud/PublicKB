### Description

VMware Tools is a suite of services and drivers supplied by VMware.  These services facilitate communication between CenturyLink Cloud's VMware vSphere environment and your server (virtual machine).  VMware Tools also provides drivers for memory management, NICs, storage, etc.  These drivers are optimized for use in a virtualized environment.  

Please note that keeping current with VMware Tools is not mandatory in order to receive support for your server in our environment.  VMware supports a wide variety of versions of VMWare Tools with each version of vSphere.  Because of this, an installed version of VMware Tools receives support for a long time.  There are times when a version of VMware Tools contains a bug that is fixed in a later release.  If you encounter the bug condition, it is recommended to upgrade.  As we lifecycle our infrastructure, we may encounter a condition where your version of VMware Tools is so old that it is no longer supported by our current version of vSphere.  If this happens, it will be necessary for you to upgrade to a newer version.

If you would like to update the version of VMware Tools on your servers, this is now available as a self-service task.  This article will discuss the steps needed for you to complete this upgrade.
