### Overview

This document describes how to launch a script package for patching and how to collect information on patches deployed.

This service allows the user to patch a VM to the latest available patches provided by the OS vendor. It does not discriminate patches based on patch severity or any other vendor categorization. The package will kick off one or multiple attempts to apply patches, including a series of reboots. Reboots will cease and the execution will complete when there are no more patches to apply.


Currently, the Operating Systems that may be updated with this service are show below:

* CentOS 5
* CentOS 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Windows 2012
* Windows 2012R2


### Audience

CenturyLink Cloud Users

### Prerequisites

* A sales agreement for CenturyLink Cloud with CenturyLink (not Tier3)
* Servers with Operating Systems listed in the Overview, above
* Careful consideration of the impacts of applying all available patches to a server
* Targeted server(s) must be able to access the internet


### Exceptions

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS: This service will exclude some updates. It will exclude kernel patches and nss packages.

### Support

If you have any concerns with the use or affects of this product, please submit a support ticket to CenturyLink Cloud.

If you have suggestions for improvement, please submit a feature request.

### Pricing

This service is free of charge.

### Execution Options

There are three ways to deploy the package, described below. With a Blueprint, the script package can be executed against one VM at a time. Control Portal's server group action functionality can execute against all VMs in a server group. An API request can deploy against all VMs a user is authorized to administer under a single alias.

For any method you choose, the following table will assist you with data needed for execution.


**Operating Systems** | **Blueprint Name** | **Script Package Name** | **Package ID**
 --- | --- | --- | ---
 Windows 2012 and 2012R2 | Auto Patching Windows 2012 | Auto Patching Windows 2012 | b229535c-a313-4a31-baf8-6aa71ff4b9ed
 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 OR CentOS 5 and 6 | Yum Update Script | Yum Update | 5d743f04-a9ce-4174-a7c8-52df93c47c08


### Option 1: Blueprint

Using a Blueprint, you can deploy patches against a single server through Control Portal.

#### Steps

1\. Maintenance Mode

The process initiated by the script package may include several, automated reboots, so - regardless how you choose to execute the package - please disable alerts by putting the server(s) in maintenance mode first.

2\. Select the Blueprint

Locate and select the appropriate Blueprint within the Blueprint Library. See the table above for the name of the Blueprint.

![Windows Update Scripts Blueprint Image](../images/Patching/PatchaaS_WindowsUpdateHoverProd.png)

![YUM Update Script Blueprint Image](../images/Patching/PatchaaS_YumUpdateBP.png)



3\. Click the Deploy Blueprint Button

4\. Set required parameters

Select whether you want to run under the default server administrator or specify credentials. Select the server you want to patch from the drop down. Press the green “next step 2” button.

5\. Review and Confirm the Blueprint

6\. Deploy the Blueprint

You will see the deployment details stating the Blueprint is queued for execution. This will kick off the Blueprint deploy process and load a page where you can track the deployment progress. Deployment times may vary. Please wait for the build queue to update deployment status.

7\. Deployment Complete

The execution will continue even after the completion of the script so please leave your server in maintenance mode until you receive an email informing you of completion.

8\. Execution Complete

After the patching is complete you will receive an email that patching is complete. Please remove the server from maintenance mode.



### Option 2: Group Action

Control Portal's server group action functionality allows for execution of a script package against one or multiple servers in a server group.

#### Steps

1\. Maintenance Mode

The process initiated by the script package may include several, automated reboots, so - regardless how you choose to execute the package - please disable alerts by putting the server(s) in maintenance mode first.

2\. Execute Action

Navigate to the group and select "execute package" from the [action drop-down](../Servers/using-group-tasks-to-install-software-and-run-scripts-on-groups.md). The name of the package to search for is in the table above.


![Patching_GroupActionWindows](../images/Patching/PatchaaS_GroupAction.png)

![Patching_GroupActionYum](../images/Patching/PatchaaS_GroupActionYum.png)


3\. Deployment Complete

  The execution will continue even after the completion of the script so please leave your server in maintenance mode until you receive an email informing you of completion.

4\. Execution Complete

After the patching is complete you will receive an email that patching is complete. Please remove the server from maintenance mode.


### Option 3: API

An API request can deploy against all VMs a user is authorized to administer under a single alias.

#### Steps

1\. Maintenance Mode

The process initiated by the script package may include several, automated reboots, so - regardless how you choose to execute the package - please disable alerts by putting the server(s) in maintenance mode first.

2\. Execute Package

Please reference [API Documentation about authentication](https://www.ctl.io/api-docs/v2/#authentication) to retrieve the Bearer token to include in all other requests. Review the [Execute Package](https://www.ctl.io/api-docs/v2/#server-actions-execute-package) to determine how to proceed. There are currently no parameters to add. Below is a JSON example:


  ```
  {
    "servers": [
        "{servername1}", "{servername2}"
    ],
    "package": {
        "packageId": "94644f15-a6c6-4db2-881a-bf645a56cbe0",
        "parameters": {

        }
    }
}
```

3\. Execution Complete

After the patching is complete you will receive an email that patching is complete. Please remove the server from maintenance mode.




### Summary of All Patches Deployed to a Server

A history of all executions against your server is available for your review. The response will contain a high-level overview of all the patches installed for each execution and when they were applied.
