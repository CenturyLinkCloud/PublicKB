<p>This can be done quite easily through the&nbsp;<a href="https://control.ctl.io/">CenturyLink Cloud Control Portal</a>. It's important the Control Portal and your server's password match in order to perform certain control functions such as adding disks, IP addresses, and deploying blueprints. There are a couple of pre-requisites that you will need to be able to perform this task:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First you must have an account which has Admin access for your company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Next you will need to have the prior password for the server which was sent to you when your server was created. If this password has changed, please change it back within the Operating System to match the portal before proceeding.</li>
</ol>
 If you meet both the requirements then you will just need to get logged in to the Control Portal and follow the steps below:
From the left navigation menu choose **Infrastructure** > **Servers**.

<p>This will take you to the Servers page, which lists the servers in your environment. Select the server who's administrator password you wish to change then click on the "settings" button.</p>

</p>

<p>This takes you to the Server Settings page where you can change the server admin/root password. Click on the "password" field. You must enter the old admin/root password in order to change to a new password.</p>

</p>

<p>Press the save button to save your changes and apply your new password.</p>
