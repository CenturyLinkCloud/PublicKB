<h3>Description</h3>
<p>All actions performed by users in the CenturyLink Cloud are recorded. The CenturyLink Cloud Activity Account History log can be viewed on the CenturyLink Cloud Control Portal or exported to as a CSV file for further analysis. This log includes the activities performed by users within an account and any sub-accounts.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Using the left navigation bar select Settings > Account Settings > Activity.</p>
    <p>Review the filtering options for the history list. Users can add keywords, apply a date range, and choose which accounts or sub-accounts to search.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Add keywords to filter based on any text value within the log entry. Keyword filters are applied as an "AND" not an "OR", so all values in the keyword box must match the log entry. In the entry below, the user searched for any place where the words
    "Add" and "F" (for the F: drive) were in the log entry.
